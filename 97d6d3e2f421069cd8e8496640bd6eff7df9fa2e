      "message": "That\u0027s mainly what my cleanup in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/771442/10 is about. This connection class would be used in the \"Connect xyz to ZooKeeper\" changes (sometimes as a context manager), but I thought it would be nicer to have only a single class as entry point to ZooKeeper.\n\nAs the cleanup mentioned above was previously further up in the stack, I rebased it on top of this change to directly incorporate it as a fixup/squash commit. AFAIK I still have to adapt the \"Connect xyz to ZooKeeper\" patches to make that fully work as there might be some leftovers from the rebase.",

      "message": "-1: We need to run this frequently because it\u0027s the only way we\u0027re going to restart builds when an executor crashes.  But since that\u0027s the only case we need to handle, I think we could do it every 60 seconds.  It\u0027s okay if we have to wait a full minute in case an executor crashes.\n\nWe also need to move this to the scheduler, because it\u0027s doing work that applies to all zones, not just the ones this executor is subscribed to.  We\u0027ll have a full cache on the schedulers, but a smaller one on the executors.  Also, if all executors go offline, it would still be nice for the schedulers to clean the system up so it doesn\u0027t look like builds are still running.",

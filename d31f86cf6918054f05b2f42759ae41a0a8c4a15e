      "message": "The scope of this repo object and therefore its config writer should be to the end of this method. At that point __del__ should be called to free up the lock. However the commit message implies this doesn\u0027t work when another config write has been instantiated for the same repo.\n\nI would not expect the normal case to fail here which implies that the second case with another config writer is the one causing problems. But if we remove the lock file out from under that writer what happens?\n\nAt the very least I think we need to better justify how this solves the problem because right now I think it just introduces more bugs.",

      "message": "Both of these solutions are going to cause one of two errors to happen - Looks like config_writer uses a file based lock, so when config_writer eventually falls out of scope itll either error because its trying to release a lock that doesnt exist or even worse itll release a lock for another config_writer.\n\nIf we *really* want to do this, we need to monkeypatch the release method to do nothing along with this and maybe even monkey patch the acquire method to raise an error in case another write occurs.\n\nBasically, this problem is not fun :(",

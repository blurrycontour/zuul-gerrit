The default values are evaluated when the function is parsed not when it is called.\n\nA common way around this is to set it to None then have a quick if not files: files \u003d [] at the start of the function.",

      "message": "I generally treat dict and list parameters as read only, unless there\u0027s an explicit contract that they should be read-write (for example, a recursive function).  This pattern exists in several other places in Zuul, and in the one case where I needed to modify the passed in list, I did this at the top of the function:\n\n        dependent_changes \u003d dependent_changes[:]\n\n(Which makes a copy of the list.)  That\u0027s in launcher/jenkins.py.\n\nIn short, I think it\u0027s safer to be conservative about modifying passed values, and I don\u0027t think it needs a comment.",

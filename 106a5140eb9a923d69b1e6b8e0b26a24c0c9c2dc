      "message": "Yeah, cleaning up right after a failed rebase would be an option.\n\nI still see a chance that we might end up with a broken repo in some cases. What I\u0027ve seen is that a leftover `.git/rebase-merge` file will not lead to an error during repo reset. So we can\u0027t really rely on the `rmtree` to resolve that situation.\n\nI\u0027m open to adding the cleanup here as well, but I think we should still perform a cleanup during reset if necessary.",

Currently the global \"tabs\" (Status, Projects, Jobs, Labels, Nodes, Autoholds, Builds, Buildsets) are always in a second line and are easily accessible ...\n\u003e This change will, at many screen widths, move those tabs into the top line inside of a small horizontally scrolling window.  \n\nThis has been resolved with https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/857245 which moves this to a tertiary nav bar, which is designed to be always below the header.

      "message": "This is essentially equivalent to the \"combined_vars\" before, which was named to indicate that it was parent variables plus job variables.  Seeing it here next to \"secret_vars\" makes me wonder if it\u0027s a superset of secret_vars (it\u0027s not).  Granted, the name \"combined_vars\" isn\u0027t much better in that regard, but it\u0027s not as definitive as \"all\".\n\nIf you want to rename it, maybe we could name it \"normal_vars\"?\n\nBoth of these methods are \"combined\" (ie, parent + job), so I don\u0027t think it\u0027s useful to add that descriptor anymore.",

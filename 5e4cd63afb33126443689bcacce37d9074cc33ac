      "message": "Better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission. Just assume both the option and the file it references are there, and catch the KeyError (if option does not exist) or IOError (if file does not exist). In fact, you could eschew try / except entirely and let the exception bubble up. It\u0027s sufficiently informative in both cases.",

      "message": "That\u0027s really more of a coding style recommendation. While I agree that just letting exceptions fly is slightly more efficient in tight loops (and absolutely more Pythonic), my years of abuse by lower-level languages also makes me lean on conditionals when there\u0027s no real need. There are plenty of similar conditional checks throughout this program, so I don\u0027t think one more is worth debating.",

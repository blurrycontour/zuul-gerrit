      "message": "Unfortunately, this will be *all* of the executors, but executors.accepting would only be the unzoned ones.\n\nI think we should make zuul.executors.X be all executors; zuul.executors.zone.\u003czone\u003e.X be each zone, and zuul.executors.unzoned.X be the unzoned executors.  That also avoids name collisions.  I have implemented this in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/777852",

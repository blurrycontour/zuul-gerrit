We don\u0027t want to require a review from every member of the team before merging, but instead we look for 2 positive review from those people.\n\nDo we want to teach zuul about number-of-codeowners? Or do we want to just have zuul ensure that if there are reviews from codeowners they are all positive? Or am I completely misunderstanding the situation?",

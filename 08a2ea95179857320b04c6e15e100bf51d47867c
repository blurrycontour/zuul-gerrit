      "message": "\u003e Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1\n\u003e \n\u003e (2 comments)\n\u003e \n\u003e It would be useful to indicate whether everything currently possible with files/irrelevant-files is possible with filesets, or if there will be a reduction in functionality.  Maybe some examples of old/new syntax (\"if you do something now, here\u0027s how you do the same thing with filesets\").\n\u003e \n\u003e You should address the use of re2 since that\u0027s the long-term goal.\n\nI\u0027ll work on some examples. Already switched to re2 in the implementation proposal and tests have passed and I\u0027ll add a comment about it in the spec in the next patch.",

      "message": "I think this also gets confusing with e.g. Github where you have multiple commits as part of a PR. So in that case it should probably apply to the PR message?!\n\nThe other problem I see is that it might not be possible to determine if the commit or PR/MR/... message changed between different \u0027versions\u0027 of a change. It could work for Gerrit where you still have the older patchsets, but I\u0027m not sure about the other providers.\n\nAt the moment we only look a the change itself and not at the diff between patchsets/versions so this would be a new concept that I think should not be mixed with the fileset proposed here.",

      "message": "Thanks for the comments. I indeed was thinking about changes between Gerrit patchsets. Agreed to remove this part from the spec. I realized now that there is some special handling of COMMIT_MSG in the current file matchers related to Gerrit / Github support. My current approach to always add COMMIT_MSG to the excludes list may not cover all cases. I realize there is still a gap in testing fileset compared to the existing matchers...",

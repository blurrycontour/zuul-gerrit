      "message": "I think this also gets confusing with e.g. Github where you have multiple commits as part of a PR. So in that case it should probably apply to the PR message?!\n\nThe other problem I see is that it might not be possible to determine if the commit or PR/MR/... message changed between different \u0027versions\u0027 of a change. It could work for Gerrit where you still have the older patchsets, but I\u0027m not sure about the other providers.\n\nAt the moment we only look a the change itself and not at the diff between patchsets/versions so this would be a new concept that I think should not be mixed with the fileset proposed here.",

How about we remove the (?) icon, and make the mouseover for the pipeline type icon include the description?  So if you mouseover the flask it says \"Independent pipeline: every change is independent of other changes...\" or something similar.\n\nI turned it into a tooltip. We lose the link to the documentation, but this is something I can live with!",

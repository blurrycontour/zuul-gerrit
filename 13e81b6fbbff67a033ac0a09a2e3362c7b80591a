      "message": "is_resumed is cleared when we pause. But we try to wait for empty queues above before waiting on _resumed. I think that means we\u0027ll just cycle in this loop unless the queues are already empty when we pause. Rather than doing the nicer to cpu wait() call.\n\nShould we drop this condition and let things flush before pausing? or drop the empty queues condition in the if above?\n\nPerhaps another approach is to start with the much simpler implementation at https://review.opendev.org/588610 and modify from there if necessary? Note this change flushes the management queue then doesn\u0027t bother with the state of the other queues before pausing.",

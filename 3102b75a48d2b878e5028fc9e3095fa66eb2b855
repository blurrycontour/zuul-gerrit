      "message": "Nit, it seems that the looking in the list of values for the state_keys dict is the primary operation we perform on this data structure. It might be slightly more efficient to store the data with the blob key as the dict key then membership lookups can be done with the hash lookup rather than a list scan.\n\nReturning values() vs keys() should be roughly equivalent so the improvement is minor.",

For example, dex could be used to generate JWT based on oauth/openid connect logins: https://github.com/dexidp/dex\n\nWe should mention that here (and in the docs) so it\u0027s clear that even though Zuul has a utility to generate JWT, that isn\u0027t the only way -- that having another authentication mechanism generate JWT is probably the preferred way.",

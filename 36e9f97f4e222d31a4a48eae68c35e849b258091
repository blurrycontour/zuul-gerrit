      "message": "We discussed this on IRC and basically this was done to make sure that assertFalse(accepting_work) wouldn\u0027t fail due to a manageLoad() running and flipping it back to true because min starting builds was 1. Setting it to zero preventing this from every happening.\n\nIn a different change corvus updated the order in which we start running a job and call manageLoad() which makes this deterministic as long as we are holding jobs in queue without setting this to 0.",

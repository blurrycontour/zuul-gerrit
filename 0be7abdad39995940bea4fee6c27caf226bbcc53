I understand that the code names are gone, replaced by just the regular names, however, both of them are completely user defined and arbitrary anyway.\n\nAt any rate, if we agree that it should be done, I think it should be a separate change, as it is quite substantial, and it requires that each line in this (large) diff be evaluated for whether it\u0027s just changing names, or actually changing the functionality described in the commit message.",

      "message": "This change is trying to bring out test suite closer into line with how we are using gerrit since those are typically the scenarios our tests are written for. I agree that it is arbitrary, but this - in my mine - makes it clearer given our workflow.\n\nI agree it makes it a large change, but if possible I\u0027d prefer not to have to refactor it out given the large dependency chain in these patchsets. If you need me to though I can :-)",

On the other hand, in the tests we set up a lot of simulations where we want to have full control over the environment.  I\u0027d like to know if anything changes because of this, but I\u0027m distracted by the spelling change.",

I think it is useful to indicate the hierarchy and to help users visually navigate the displayed data.  And it\u0027s a place where we can afford to use some more space.\n\nI just zoomed your change to 150% and the font sizes of the two things definitely do not look like what we currently have.  I see a very small but noticeably useful difference in the title of the pipeline.",

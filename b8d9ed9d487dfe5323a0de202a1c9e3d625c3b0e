      "message": "This is the thing that concerns me a bit.  We apparently thought pragma was special enough we should always obey it.  But I agree you have found a situation where you don\u0027t want it.  And basically anyone with a tenant config with \u0027include\u0027 will need to make a change in order to keep the status quo.\n\nWhat we have now \"include: [\u0027job\u0027]\" is so simple, straightforward, and intuitive, and \u0027pragma\u0027 is such a weird and advanced concept, I sort of hesitate to suggest that everyone should need to remember to \"include\" pragma in order for jobs to work as intended.\n\nIf we keep the change as-is, we should probably at least split it into two in order to let people add pragma as a no-op now, then make the actual change shortly afterwords.\n\nBut I wonder if, instead, we could do something like make pragma \"exclude only\".  Like, it\u0027s always included unless you add an exclude line.  So if I remember your case correctly, it would be:\n  include: job\n  exclude: pragma\n\nMaybe that would be a reasonable compromise between having the ability to disable it, but having things work as expected/designed by default?",

      "message": "Why does pre_failed imply unreachable?  It seems like there are plenty of reasons to have pre playbooks fail other than that.  We probably need to add unreachable handling to the pre-run playbook to set a \"pre_unreachable\" variable.\n\nAlso, this should include \"run_unreachable\" (which I acknowledge is covered by pre_failed currently, but we shouldn\u0027t rely on that).",

      "message": "True, I think `zuul_unreachable` might not convey what I\u0027m interested in here. What I want to know is if the job will (most likely) be retried.\n\nThis in combination with `zuul.attempts` and `zuul.max_attempts` can then be used to perform a certain action only for the final run of a job (e.g. interacting with an external system).\n\nSo maybe `zuul_retry`?",

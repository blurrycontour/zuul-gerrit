      "message": "I think the `QueueCard` (visualizing a single queue) should only take care about the state for a single queue. The `areAllQueuesExpanded` state should be lifted to a higher component (`PipelineSummary` is the right one, I think) and be passed down as property to the `QueueCard`. We could then use the value provided by this property directly as default value for the `isQueueExpanded` state. This way we could also avoid the code in lines 76-80 (which tries to match the different states).\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```\nfunction QueueCard({pipeline, queue, allQueuesExpanded}) {\n  const [isQueueExpanded, setIsQueueExpanded] \u003d useState(allQueuesExpanded)\n  \n  const onQueueToggle \u003d () \u003d\u003e {\n  ...\n```",

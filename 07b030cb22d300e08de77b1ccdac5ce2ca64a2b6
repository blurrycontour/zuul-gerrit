      "message": "Good point. The ItemPanel is also used for the single change view, but apparently that is not reachable anymore in this change. It is reachable again in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/916287/9. It\u0027s not ideal, but could you check out that change? Click on a pipeline name to go to the PipelineDetailsView for that pipeline and then click on the \"Show details\" link on a QueueItem: https://imgur.com/a/3CNRu86. That will open the single change view where the item panel is used in the same way it was also used on the old status page.\n\nAFAIK I didn\u0027t change anything on the helper methods between this change and 916287, so the styling should be the same.",

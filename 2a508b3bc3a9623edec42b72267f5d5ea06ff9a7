      "message": "I don\u0027t remember the detail of the previous implementation, but it seems like this change no longer match the above documentation. That is, this function always discards the sub-directory and returns `scheme://domain/`.\n\nMoreover, looking at the callsites, it appears that the `url` parameter is never set, so we might as well remove it from the definition.",

Using `window.location.href` returns `scheme://entire-href\u0027, and that\u0027s what was returned previously as well (AFAICT).\n\nWhere did you see the `callsites` ? (Sorry, not a JS expert ðŸ˜Š ). Happy to remove the param if there are no calls to this function passing it.",

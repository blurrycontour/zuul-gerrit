      "message": "It\u0027s a little bit nit-picky, but jqXHR.statusText is only for backward compatibility with XMLHttpRequest. This isn\u0027t an issue in itself, but we are accepting statusText as an attribute so it looks like this is wrong. I can imagine we\u0027ll get a question about accessing the jqXHR object when statusText is already there, so maybe we should just use it to begin with to be neater?",

      "message": "I did it because I was concerned about the actual value being different. It looked like statusText was set by XHR/browser/user and the jqXHR normalised by jQuery.ajax to \"abort\".\n\nThere\u0027s some funkiness going on with nativeStatusText (assigned to jqXHR.statusText) vs. jQuery\u0027s own statusText (passed as second argument). However I see now that jQuery\u0027s own statusText also defaults to nativeStatusText if available. (Where in case of abort, native \u003d jQuery\u0027s strAbort).",

      "message": "Oh I\u0027m sorry I should have commented on that.\n\nThe easiest way to test this code is to use it in test_zk, which doesn\u0027t start a full zuul so it\u0027s difficult to instantiate a merge client.  But it is easy to instantiate a merger api.  This code also fits very well into the merger api (possibly it\u0027s even better there), so I think it\u0027s okay to move.\n\nAnd yes, I agree we should move the equivalent executor code into the executor api.",

      "message": "This watcher class is 1:1 with a connection, and the connection has a canonical hostname.  So we can use tenant.getProject(self.connection.canonical_hostname + \u0027/\u0027 + event.project_name) to fully qualify the project name.\n\nOf course tenant.getProject is going to immediately split that into two strings again, so this is a really good case for refactoring that method into two: one that takes a string, and one that takes two arguments (hostname, project name).  Or at least leaving a TODO here for that.  :)",

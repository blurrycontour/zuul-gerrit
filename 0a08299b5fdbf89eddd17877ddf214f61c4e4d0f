      "message": "This is a partial review. I\u0027ve reviewed everything but the tests and the alembic migration. I want to post this now before I\u0027ve reviewed the rest of it because its a big change and I need to pop out for a bit.\n\nOne other observation I\u0027ve made is that we seem to be mixing together some logically distinct updates to the database. There is the addition of the refs table and the refs association table and all of the FKs for that. Then separately we seem to be updating the sizes of some existing columns and renaming indexes/foreign keys/etc.\n\nI suspect we may do the width change here because it is more efficient to do that since we are copying the data anyway? But maybe the renames of existing indexes and foreign keys should be a distinct migration?",

      "message": "I think we should add a tooltop with text like \"Change the order that pipelines are displayed on the page\".  Since it\u0027s right next to a filter input that will actually filter out individual changes, I think it\u0027s important that we clarify that this affects only entire pipelines.  It should mostly be obvious, but the tooltip will help in the rare cases it isn\u0027t.",

It seems a little more natural.\n\nI\u0027m trying to find a word or phrase other than \"Initial\" that means \"the configuration specified by the tenant admin\" but haven\u0027t come up with anything yet.  I would like to indicate that the admin-specified order is not necessarily arbitrary or random.  If we can\u0027t figure that out, \"initial\" is fine.",

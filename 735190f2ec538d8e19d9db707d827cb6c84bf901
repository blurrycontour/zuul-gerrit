      "message": "What about adding a \"protected-branch\" requirement?  That would match the event only if the branch of the ref (refs/heads/.*) matched a protected branch?\n\nI think that may be worth doing regardless because \"push\" and \"pull_request\" pipelines are subtly different (you may end up with a different sha on a merge commit, and push pipelines can respond to someone manually pushing to the branch).\n\nNone of that detracts from this change which stands on its own.",

      "message": "Is it possible that by stopping the job above the ws_client_thread will read fewer than the full 1025 bytes? Maybe before allowing the job to complete above we can check the size of the buffer read by ws_client_thread to ensure it is at least 1025 bytes or 1024 characters?\n\nWithout this I worry the assert on line 325 could be racey and potentially lead to a flaky test.",

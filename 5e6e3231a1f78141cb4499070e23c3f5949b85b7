      "message": "I think it would make sense to define a dictionary here, that contains all necessary attributes as value whereby the key is the same as pipeline.manager. This way, you could simply look up the value from the dictionary without a lot of if/else branches in renderPipelineIcon(). I used this approach here https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul/src/branch/master/web/src/containers/build/Misc.jsx#L25 and here https://review.opendev.org/#/c/739973/7/web/src/containers/build/Artifact.jsx (line 33). The default value could be defined in a different variable that is used if the key wasn\u0027t found in the dictionary.",

      "message": "This import is responsible for most of the increased test time.  Because of the multi process worker used in the executor, this is imported anew for each process, and even a null test might do that about 5 times to read the configuration.  The import initializes all of the drivers.\n\n1) Let\u0027s omit this bit of type annotations for now.\n2) Let\u0027s take a look at minimizing the code needed for the spawned processes for the merger (possibly move those into static methods in a dedicated file).",

      "message": "So that when a job inherits from another, it nests.  That seems to be the most sensible behavior, especially when you think that the most ancestral job is likely to do things like push repos onto the host and collect logs.  Other jobs which inherit from it are likely to depend on that (one may have a pre-playbook which installs something from a prepared repo and a post-playbook which copies some logs into the location from which they are later collected).",

      "message": "At least as written in the spec, a job has exactly one playbook.  We can change that fairly easily if we want, but in general, I think we want to promulgate that idea, and that the component of reuse is the role.\n\nWe need multiple playbooks for pre and post so that inheritance works right (they nest).",

Where we actually change the workflow.\n\nWhen I saw this the first time, I was wondering why we didn\u0027t handle this case via a route. Then I saw that you removed the route in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/859466/7/web/src/routes.js.\n\nNow I\u0027m a little confused: Couldn\u0027t we just do the \"lingering\" within the AuthCallbackPage itself? This part here feels a little hacky.",

If we try to handle this with the router, there\u0027s too much other stuff going on that\u0027s trying to update our data.  We need to leave the window.location alone until we\u0027ve finished the login process, but trying to prevent the rest of the application from doing that is too complicated (perhaps impossible).\n\nPlus, I think this actually matches the way the auth system works better.",

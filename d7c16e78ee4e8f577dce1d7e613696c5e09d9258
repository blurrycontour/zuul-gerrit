Where we actually change the workflow.\n\nWhen I saw this the first time, I was wondering why we didn\u0027t handle this case via a route. Then I saw that you removed the route in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/859466/7/web/src/routes.js.\n\nNow I\u0027m a little confused: Couldn\u0027t we just do the \"lingering\" within the AuthCallbackPage itself? This part here feels a little hacky.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t have a great suggestion here - but the first time I read this I got confused and thought it was using Zuul as an example of a project that needed this facility. But of course Zuul doesn\u0027t have submodules - and that is not what you are saying. You are talking about an theoretical project with these characteristics and how it would be managed by zuul today.\n\nMight just be my brain having trouble reading the english. #notaminusone",

      "message": "Oh yep that was bad englishing.  The point I was trying to convey was that this is an example I\u0027m setting up with the current state of the world, not an example of the proposed change.  Mostly I added it because the immediately preceding sentence was a one-line summary of the proposed change, and I thought it might lead people to think this was an example of the proposed change.\n\nSo it should probably say:\n  Before we examine the proposed change, let\u0027s consider an example as things stand today:\n\nI\u0027ll incorporate that into the next update.",

      "message": "Hi Flavio. You are welcome and I am sorry for confusing you. That said, please bear in mind this practice is quite common in this community (compared to elsewhere) as it favours collaboration on code. I, personally, try to comment more than amend (and I think this is the general trend). Each time, I analyse quickly whether it is easier to explain in comment or just do it. I amend also when I see (or guess) a fix to a failing job and I know the original committer is away - to help improve the development velocity (as failing jobs halt the process).",

Sometimes a trivial fix can be okay, but in general, it\u0027s best to comment, or get permission to modify someone else\u0027s change.\n\nThe standard should be \"is the fix easy and obvious\" not \"can I do it faster than explaining\".

      "message": "This seems unnecessarily complex if we always pass in self.__repr__() which is formatting the string for us. Can we instead simply accept the string and set it as an attribute which we return as the __repr__ of the Attributes object?\n\nAs an alternative Attributes() is meant to be a safe to string format set of attributes related to a broader object. It is possible that broader object\u0027s internal __repr__ isn\u0027t safe for external consumption?\n\nWe might want to instead track which attributes are set on this object and then do a simple foo\u003d{foo} repr to ensure we only expose these safe attributes?",

      "message": "Huh.  My guess is that this is ancient code and didn\u0027t get updated during some change to how queues were handled.  Or maybe it never did anything.\n\nI agree it looks like it doesn\u0027t do anything now.\n\nThe intent is that if you set a new floor in the configuration, we should update that.  So the right thing to do would be to adjust all the queue values here.  If you want to punt on that and just remove this and leave a TODO, that wfm.",

I can\u0027t think of a better way right now though....\n\nMaybe we could run the docker container on a second node?  I know it\u0027s a little more ansible to set up... but probably not much more than what we have now.",

Hopefully the comment added with above helps with some of this.\n\nI do think it might be better to have this test running against separate individual containers from 2.7 -\u003e 3.\u003cX\u003e to individually and explicitly test each supported target python version.  Perhaps as part of that we could have them in a separate docker network?  Then they would all appear in 172.X?",

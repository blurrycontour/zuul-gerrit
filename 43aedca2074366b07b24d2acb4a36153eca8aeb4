Because as it stands now, any time we use add_host, we\u0027ll add the host into the inventory file.  I can see times, between run phases where we don\u0027t actually want to do that.\n\nMaybe we need to toggle a specific zuul fact to enable updating of inventory, as not to break user facing API for add_host.",

I think we should just continue working on this until it\u0027s ready to merge.\n\n1) I\u0027m not sure what you mean, can you give me another hint? ðŸ˜Š\n\n2) Fixed.\n\nNew PS includes:\n\n* Fixed gant chart colors\n* Fixed timezone color\n* Fixed background color on tenant dropdown\n* Fixed text color for \"fetching/loading\" messages",

I think we should just continue working on this until it\u0027s ready to merge.\n\n1) I\u0027m not sure what you mean, can you give me another hint? ðŸ˜Š\n\n2) Fixed.\n\nNew PS includes:\n\n* Fixed gant chart colors\n* Fixed timezone color\n* Fixed background color on tenant dropdown\n* Fixed text color for \"fetching/loading\" messages",

      "message": "1) Looks like you fixed it in PS17 -- probably by adding the PageSection variant to the Buildsets page... TBH I don\u0027t understand why it was dark with the table not being correct before you did that.  Maybe something about how if the app previously specified a variant it only changes some css?\n\nFTR https://imgur.com/Slq1obE.png is what I was referring to.",

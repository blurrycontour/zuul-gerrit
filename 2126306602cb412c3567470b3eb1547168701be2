      "message": "Looks like the voluptuous devs rejected this idea [1].\n\nThe alternative they proposed [2] however doesn\u0027t really seem to fit our use case as we only have a schema and not a full json data tree from which we could generate the schema. Generating using genson would likely get out of sync as well :(\n\nAn alternative might be to create our own tooling that generates this from the zuul source.\n\n[1] https://github.com/alecthomas/voluptuous/issues/181\n[2] https://pypi.org/project/genson/",

      "message": "Ideally we should have groups support, but we need a way to distinguish groups defined in zuul\u0027s config for convenience and scalability vs groups as claims from the Identity Provider; we don\u0027t necessarily want these to map one-to-one. The spec being complex as it is, I thought we could discuss that later, but I\u0027m okay with adding group support to the scope.",

This way dequeue would be universal and easier to use than change/ref based. Further it would be unique and we could even drop the pipeline argument.",

      "message": "I mentioned this in the matrix room as well, but I am suspicious of this method name. If repo.git.for_each_ref really is only looking at refs in packfiles then we could potentially miss refs. There was a fallback before 2e785ac7b69b8730525a4fc3c7463799e19baf60 that seemed to handle this case but that was removed in this simplification change.\n\nAssuming this was a safe simplification to make that would imply this method name of getPackedRefs() is misleading as we\u0027re getting all refs? If it is accurate then I think we may need the fallback in the reset usage otherwse we may not reset everything if the refs are loose?",

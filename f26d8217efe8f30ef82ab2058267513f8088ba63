Given that the point is to force another project to run a job, and we can\u0027t make any guarantees like \"it\u0027s always safe to force another project to run a job\" (in fact, the opposite is true; it\u0027s dangerous to do that, you could make the project publish a release), then I think we have to accept that anything else is unlikely to be more risky.\n\nTLDR: setting project variables is a subset of the risk we already would be accepting.",

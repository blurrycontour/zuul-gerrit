Vars the are the item that I\u0027m concerned may be potentially abusable. However, I guess if you can configure queue and job lists then setting vars to influence how the jobs run is also reasonable.",

Given that the point is to force another project to run a job, and we can\u0027t make any guarantees like \"it\u0027s always safe to force another project to run a job\" (in fact, the opposite is true; it\u0027s dangerous to do that, you could make the project publish a release), then I think we have to accept that anything else is unlikely to be more risky.\n\nTLDR: setting project variables is a subset of the risk we already would be accepting.",

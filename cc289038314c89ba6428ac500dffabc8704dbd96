      "message": "This is a confusing release note because it doesn\u0027t supply enough information for users to be able to know if it applies to them.  My preference would be to omit the release note altogether because it is a minor fix to an error that did not cause jobs to fail and only occurred in some circumstances.  If we have too many release notes, people won\u0027t read them, so we try to keep bugfix release notes to major bugs that affect jobs.  However, if you\u0027ve been getting questions about this and want to make sure that users know it\u0027s fixed, then I recommend rephrasing it to more accurately describe the circumstances under which it occurred.  Notably, it would only be seen when using an older kubectl or the openshift client as kubectl.  Perhaps something like:\n\nIn some cases (such as when an older version of kubectl is present on the executor, or the kubectl on the executor is from OpenShift), streaming logs from Kubernetes or OpenShift pods did not work.  The log streaming system has been corrected to work with a wider range of kubectl versions and error logging has been improved.",

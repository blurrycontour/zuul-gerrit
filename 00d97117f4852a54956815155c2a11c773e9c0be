      "message": "Well, we don\u0027t actually need it because the main purpose of the lock is so that we don\u0027t go from having no job to having a job during the pause method.  If we go from having a job to not having a job, that\u0027s actually fine.\n\nHowever, I take the point that we may be laying a trap if we ever assume that both transitions are true.  If we want to try to clean that up, then I think I would prefer that instead of setting it to false here, we move that into _runGearman below.  That means we will need to add it to the existing gear.InterruptedError clause as well as a new generic handler.  I\u0027ll write it here and we can see what it looks like.\n\nThere, how does that look?",

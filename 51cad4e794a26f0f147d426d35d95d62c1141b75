The tools directory is a bit informal and not tested.  The tutorial examples should be as minimal as possible.\n\u003e \n\u003e Given that the tools/test-setup-docker.sh script runs zk-ca.sh before docker-compose, how is this necessary?  Are you running docker-compose without using test-setup-docker.sh?  Maybe you can just add the wait into whatever script you are running.\n\n",

      "message": "It\u0027s a fair point, and I do think in general test helpers should try to get out of the way and be careful of failures like this. We probably _should_ test how Zuul handles the situation where there\u0027s no playbooks dir. But I\u0027m comfortable leaving this as-is until we do, as it\u0027s a relatively obvious failure when it comes time to add that coverage.",

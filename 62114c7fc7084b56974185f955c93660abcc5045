      "message": "The current logic reads the first-found and then returns. I think the globbing will expand the config file list correctly, but then I think you\u0027ll need to $something to read the config in from multiple files. (something something merge)\n\nI\u0027ve been wanting for a while to change this to be yaml instead of ini for consistency. If we did that and made it yaml (or, really, ADDED support for yaml so that people could migrate) - then it might be easier to read all the files in conf.d and just do a dict-merge on the yaml dicts.\n\nWe should likely get some buy in from folks on such a thing before going too far down the rabbithole.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not completely opposed to switching to YAML (if we did, it should be a switch where we support both for a limited time for migration but definitely deprecate and then remove ini).  However, we did *choose* not to do that when it would have been easier as part of the zuul v3 work.  The ini format is actually pretty intuitive for this kind of data, and there is some utility to having a visual distinction between the different kind of config files.  The ini files configure how the system is constructed and runs, the yaml files are the data it uses.  Anway, that\u0027s a longer separate discussion.  I like the .d support once the comments here are addressed.",

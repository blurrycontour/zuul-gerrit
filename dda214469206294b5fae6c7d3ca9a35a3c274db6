      "message": "I think it might make sense to take a stance and get rid of type annotations and type checking in Zuul completely. I have a different opinion on the usefulness of the annotations, but would prefer to have a clear NO instead of the current state where I don\u0027t know when it\u0027s ok to add type hints and when to leave them out.\n\nI tried to remove all type annotations from the method bodies and only kept the class + method level annotations, which I though was what we agreed on.",

      "message": "Executor has following issue: if you want it to let manage ansible with additional libraries installed it will fail, cause something in the process still tries to install those under /use/local/Zuul even with ansible_root set. Same stuff happens with zuul-manage-ansible command. I had no time yet to go deeper through the code, but eventual issue is in detection if the venv_path.\nLong story short: using Zuul user for executor make it impossible to addlibs to ansible installations",

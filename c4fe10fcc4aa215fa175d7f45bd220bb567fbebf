      "message": "Indeed, every month I refresh the expiration date on my keys to a year, as a sort of \"dead-man switch\" but I agree I should include the most recent export (I copied this from the openstack/ossa repo... I should make a note to refresh the copy in there too for the same reason). It was mostly a placeholder, but I can think of no good reason not to just update it now. Thanks!",

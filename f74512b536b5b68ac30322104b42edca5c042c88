Were now moving to a system where some of the config is parsed in the scheduler parse config method to a system where other runners are injecting configuration into the scheduler\u0027s properties, which seems like a path to impossible to debug code.\n\nIm not going to -1 for this though, I might propose a change to move it later on though :).",

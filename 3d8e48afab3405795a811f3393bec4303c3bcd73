      "message": "Like James mentioned in his comment on the commit message, probably better to just use a bitmask for the comparison. The stat module provides a number of such masks already including one which matches on any permissions for \"other\" so you could instead just do something along the lines of...\n\n    if st.st_mode \u0026 stat.S_IRWXO:\n        raise Exception(\n            \"Project key directory %s must not be world readable, writeable or traversable; current mode is %o\" % (key_dir, st.st_mode))",

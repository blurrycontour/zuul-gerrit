      "message": "as a nit (no need to change here, just be aware of the extra reference to the event_queue going forward), I don\u0027t particularly like to track the event queues directly like this since we can track them from self.connections.connections . This comes from the fact that without careful cleanup we can leak objects and cause memory bloat during test runs due to lingering references. It is unlikely this is a case here, but without a careful eye on values such as things can get out of control rapidly.",

      "message": "Do we need all this styling? I think the item should look similar to the others without applying any additional styling. Also, I don\u0027t think this item should be smaller (font-size: 11px) than others in the header toolbar. All in all, I think the item looks fine without these additional styles.\n\nJust noticed that the timezone selection has similar styles. But I think they are not needed anymore for the new layout using PF4 and could also be removed there.\n\nYou can check out the code for the navigation bar in the App.jsx file or the first example here https://www.patternfly.org/v4/documentation/react/demos/pagelayout#default-nav (just click on the \"JSX\" link below the preview image to show the source code). I also took this example to style the navigation bar in the initial PF4 change.",

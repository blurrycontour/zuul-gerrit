      "message": "Looking at the child change has helped me understand this better. I think we should consider checking for a None item.layout_uuid above so that we don\u0027t somehow accidentally start caching a layout for None (and then sharing that between changes).\n\nThen I think what you wanted the condition here to be is if not item.layout_uuid so that we log the recalculation only when there isn\u0027t already something cached. However, I think that since we\u0027ve fallen through to here that is already the case and we can just drop this condition entirely.",

      "message": "Looking at the child change has helped me understand this better. I think we should consider checking for a None item.layout_uuid above so that we don\u0027t somehow accidentally start caching a layout for None (and then sharing that between changes).\n\nThen I think what you wanted the condition here to be is if not item.layout_uuid so that we log the recalculation only when there isn\u0027t already something cached. However, I think that since we\u0027ve fallen through to here that is already the case and we can just drop this condition entirely.",

      "message": "See below for my thoughts on protecting from a null key.\n\nRegarding the conditional log line, I think what this means is: there exists a theoretical layout for this item, but we don\u0027t have it.  We need to recreate it.  I think this can only happen in a multi-scheduler situation.  Because in a single scheduler situation, the only way for an item to have a layout uuid assigned to it is to get it from a layout.  Meanwhile, if item.layout_uuid is None, then that means no one has ever made a layout for this item, so it needs to be created (\"calculated\") for the first time.",

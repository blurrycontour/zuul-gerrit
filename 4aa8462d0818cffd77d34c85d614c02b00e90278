      "message": "I know it was this way before but its a bit weird to have both trigger and management events in the same zookeeper path which is analogous to having them all in one queue there then we split them out here into two different queues.\n\nI guess we use a prefix on the znodes rather than separating them into different paths. Is there a specific reason we do that? This sort of thing might be worth calling out in the code?",

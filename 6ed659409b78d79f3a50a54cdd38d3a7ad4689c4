      "message": "This is using the relative priority calculation, but it uses it regardless of whether or not relative priority is enabled for a tenant, so it won\u0027t match what we pass to Nodepool.  That may be a little counter-intuitive for some folks.\n\nAlso, since it\u0027s intended for use by Nodepool it has some intentional optimizations that shouldn\u0027t make a difference for that use case but could be confusing; it quantizes the values at certain levels.\n\nThe number is intended to change frequently until Nodepool actually allocates a node.  The fact that it\u0027s frozen in place when the build is enqueued means it won\u0027t work the same way in a build.  Imagine a job that happens to start with a very low priority.  Circumstances change and it\u0027s at the top of the queue now.  But other items right behind it start and they actually have a higher priority.  In short, I think it\u0027s potentially dangerous to use this in a job, and I think it should be limited and retained for its intended use as an internal value.",

      "message": "Hm, I thought it might be useful to have a file for such miscellaneous (and small) components like this one - similar to the ones in builds/Misc.jsx. AFAIK we were using much of those in the past, but most probably I will add more like this and I think a single file suites that purpose better than one file per component. I\u0027m also open for better names. Misc was just the first thing that came to my mind.",

      "message": "My idea behind that was to make the buildset result page look similar to the build result page (which by now has three tabs). There is already a follow-up change for this (https://review.opendev.org/#/c/739972/) if you want to take a  look. I still have to do some work there due to rebasing but the major part is already done. Just as a side node: In the buildset result page change I\u0027m using a navigation bar rather than tabs because I didn\u0027t get the tabs to work with the special routing layout (three URL endpoints) of the build result page. However, I have already an improvement for that in place (https://review.opendev.org/#/c/740629/) which will enable us to also use tabs there.",

      "message": "It\u0027s probably obvious, but the zuul-executor should do little more than collect the job and run the zuul runner (at least in terms of code path, I wouldn\u0027t suggest the implementation necessarily call out to a zuul-runner binary).",

      "message": "One of the big use cases I was originally designing this for was to try out new job definitions locally.\n\nBeing able to take an uncommitted set of changes to zuul.d/, point zuul-runner at an API endpoint, and have everything calculated and ran as if it were merged.\n\nPerhaps that\u0027s not the scope of this spec though and could be future work.",

      "message": "Perfect for the scope of this work, but I also envisioned it\u0027d be awesome if a user could launch nodes in a cloud using images from nodepool or something just by supplying their own credentials (or libvirtd etc). This would likely be a big task though and certainly something outside of this spec.",

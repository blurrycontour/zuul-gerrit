Therefore in the worst case scenario, during a keys rotation, we can end up with valid tokens signed with a new key failing to be accepted by Zuul for at most 5 minutes.\n\nIt is recommended to rotate keys every 3-6 months, so while you\u0027d have to be extremely unlucky to hit the authenticated API during such a rotation using a signing key not present in the cache, this can happen and thus should be acknowledged, if only as a comment in the code.",

I think I agree that we can live with that for now.\n\nI think the only thing that \"sucks\" about zuul restarting is that we don\u0027t save the queues automatically -- something that we can and should fix.  Of course, the config parsing is going to be a huge part of restarting in v3.  That may \"suck\" too.",

      "message": "ignore_aliases will pull from the positional args list, not the keyword args list, so this is not equivalent to my suggestion.  \n\nYou could put it between *args and **kwargs.  I\u0027m not a fan of that, and we haven\u0027t done that anywhere else -- mostly because the whole \"args, kwargs\" pattern is so well set.\n\nOr you could use kwargs.pop, which I think is pretty clear.",

      "message": "As written, the calling convention for this method is very unclear.  ignore_aliases is a required argument if any further positional arguments without default values are going to be supplied (and since we accept them, we should assume they may be).\n\nansible_unsafe_dump(inventory, ignore_aliases\u003dTrue) is valid\nansible_unsafe_dump(inventory, foo, ignore_aliases\u003dTrue) is invalid\n\nThat\u0027s very confusing.  Let\u0027s do something more straightforward.  Here are the choices I think would be okay (with the most preferable first):\n\n1) kwargs.pop() -- it is simple and doesn\u0027t rely on any special understanding of the function signature\n2) (data, *args, ignore_aliases\u003dFalse, **kwargs) -- behaves the same way, but maintainers may blink a few times at seeing *args and *kwargs separated like that.\n3) (data, ignore_aliases, *args, **kwargs) -- the positional equivalent of #2.  This breaks compatibility with the similar safe_dump methods, but is at least explicit.",

      "message": "Specifying this in the tenant config was done in the spec. However there was a discussion on IRC a few weeks back with the conclusion that it\u0027s actually better to decide this based on the queue since circular dependencies operate in the same shared queue which makes this a natural choice.\n\nThis way it\u0027s more flexible as the project can decide without an admin while still keeping the possibility to disallow cyclic deps in a config project.",

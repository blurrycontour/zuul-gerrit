That tests the main part of this new feature: \"don\u0027t bother loading static config for this branch, but instead create a dynamic config every time\".\n\nChange #3 is a proposed change to overwrite the in-repo config so that instead of running \"project-test\" it only runs \"project-dynamic\".  That tests that even when we\u0027re doing the main thing this feature adds (which is treating static config as dynamic) we also still support changing the dynamic config.  In other words, this tests that dynamic config works in the way it normally does on proposed changes to zuul.yaml in all cases.",

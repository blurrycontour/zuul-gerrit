      "message": "It\u0027s to handle ref-updated events.  Some folks pull from zuul repos for post jobs; I think we always pull from gerrit.  Regardless, this makes it so that you can pull from a zuul merger for a ref-updated event like you can now pull from zuul.  This could probably be reworked a bit more (perhaps even to set a zuul ref), but it\u0027s as close to the current behavior as possible.\n\nYou\u0027ll note elsewhere the change-with-ref vs change-without-ref dichotomy (prepareRef in particular).",

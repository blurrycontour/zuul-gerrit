      "message": "Yes. As the pipeline can contain multiple jobs, I can\u0027t link to all of them. However, it makes sense to link to zuul status page only when the pipeline is in progress, so I\u0027ve changed it in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/191312/41 that the link is removed when the pipeline finishes.\nLink(s) to the build(s) is always put into a comment.\n\nAlso please see change https://review.openstack.org/#/c/325300/4 which allows to add a link with a filter for the particular Github pull request.",

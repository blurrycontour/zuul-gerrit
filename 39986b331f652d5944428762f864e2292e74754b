Considering the volume of data we\u0027re starting to transfer (and the frequency), I think we might want to try to limit it to just the subject for now, so I think I agree with Joshua.\n\nBut at any rate, model.py has \u0027subject\u0027 already, so I think all this file needs is s/summary/subject/.",

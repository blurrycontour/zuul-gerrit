      "message": "Fundamentally, a pipeline is a set of triggering, prioritizing, scheduling, and reporting rules. A project pipeline (which I\u0027m also adding an entry for) is the association of a pipeline with a set of jobs and related trigger filters and job dependencies for a particular project, effectively what to run (or avoid running) in a given pipeline. I\u0027ll try to better reflect some of that here, though the pipeline and project pipeline entries should contain the bulk of that explanation.",

      "message": "base_sha is actually fairly important.  Without it we are unable to correctly calculate the set of changed files.  The difference is and will be observable to users who will not understand why jobs they expect to run are not running, or the other way around.\n\nWhat are the options for waiting until gitlab\u0027s async work is completed?",

      "message": "Internally Zuul uses the merger\u0027s fileschanges task to compute the files diff between the PR Head and the target branch HEAD if base_sha is not provided (None). Thus the fix in the parent change. This is simulated in the tests (the additional addCommit) and validated on a test instance connected to gitlab.com.\n\nAn other option I\u0027ve proposed but then abandonned for this one was https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/867804/",

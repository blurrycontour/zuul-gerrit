      "message": "Well, we were using sudo before when it was a system package so this is as similar and simple as I could make it. We could perhaps do --user instead but would likely need to update the executable path on all git-review invocations later. As for the pip module from ansible, will that still use Python 3? I copied the same pattern we\u0027re using to install zuul in playbooks/zuul-stream/pre.yaml but if you have a good example where we\u0027re using the pip module I\u0027m happy to adapt it.",

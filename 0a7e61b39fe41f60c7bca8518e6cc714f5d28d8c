      "message": "Can you split that out into a separate change?  The reason the password is required is because we never thought it would make sense to do anything with a keystore without having the password.  Perhaps it does make sense, and perhaps the best way to do that is to pass in a fake password that is the empty string.  But I\u0027d really like to evaluate that on its own; it doesn\u0027t seem to be required for this change.\n\n(I might have ideas like: perhaps when we don\u0027t supply a password we should use \"None\" or a sentinel object so that we can explicitly check that any time we actually use the password and crash instead of accidentally encrypting a key with a blank password.)",

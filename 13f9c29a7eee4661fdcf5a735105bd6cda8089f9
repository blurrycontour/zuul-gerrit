      "message": "One thought/concern here. Is there some other attribute/value that we need to check for no_log state that we\u0027ll now skip over? Previously we raised an exception and didn\u0027t add the data to self.results so that was equivalent to censoring. But now we\u0027ll potentially continue and log anyway.\n\nMaybe we need to check the type is string to be specific?",

      "message": "Honestly per the note, I think that Ansible has fixed things so that we will not actually ever get in here with individual tasks having this set.  It\u0027s already filtered out as \"censored\" before the result is passed in here.  But, I haven\u0027t proved that to myself, hence not reverting this.  This seems totally free-form as to what any plugin may return here, so we\u0027ll always have some variation...\n\nI\u0027ve proposed a test in the follow-on Ib0d2360f98daf33e05207c9c285528ce2f51cbf9.  I think that will help we don\u0027t regress here, if we do fiddle things.",

I\u0027ve left a suggestion on the child change for improving the test to try and cover this specific thing.",

      "message": "So I can no longer get Ansible actually into this code path; empirically, v2_runner_on_ok does not actually receive anything it should not log.  even something like\n\n - name: loopit\n   foo:\n    bar: \u0027arg\u0027\n   no_log: \u0027{{ item }}\u0027\n   loop:\n     - true\n     - false\n\nwill be censored; for the above v2_runner_on_ok just receives a result._result value of\n\n {\u0027censored\u0027: \u0027...\u0027, changed: False}\n\n(I belive this is https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/bda074d34e46ee9862a48ed067ad42260d3f92ab -- task is no_log if any item is)\n\nThe fact that we could get here at all was the original bug, since fixed in Ansible.  I would propose removing this, but that will involve getting 3 people (including myself) to all read through the ansible changes and convince themselves that we can indeed no longer get here.  It\u0027s not an API as such, there\u0027s no documentation on what is being passed in (I can find).  So that\u0027s why I left it as the \"abundance of caution\" comment ...\n\nSo I can\u0027t really get this path tested, because you can\u0027t hit it?",

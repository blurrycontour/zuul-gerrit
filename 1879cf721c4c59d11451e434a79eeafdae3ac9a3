      "message": "Yeah so I did initially keep it in the scheduler probably as you were thinking. But I found it a bit odd and cumbersome to use ActionReporter to just store the reporter and the params. It meant triggering the report looked like:\n\naction_reporter.reporter(change, msg, action_reporter.params)\n\nRather than having to continually pass back the params the action_reporter itself can just implement some helper options. I felt this was still keeping it in a model type state without adding in logic.",

      "message": "I think this may have been the source of confusion on my part regarding \"machine like containers\". From my perspective you are most likely to interact with them without a kubernetes. LXD/LXC for example.\n\nMaybe we want to scope this spec to k8s support in nodepool/zuul and worry about other thingpool items including lxc/lxd and other machine like containers separately?\n\nMy previous concerns were that we were assuming k8s was the only way to get a machine like container hence the reliance on k8s specific access methods. I think that concern persists unless we want to scope this specifically to k8s rather than the bigger \"containers\".",

That\u0027s not what I would get from reading the variable/key names (where I would assume \"release_nodeset: False\" means don\u0027t release the nodeset, rather than, release the nodeset and call the job a failure.\n\nThat at least warrants some comments, but it might be better to split this into two keys: release_nodeset, and preliminary_result.",

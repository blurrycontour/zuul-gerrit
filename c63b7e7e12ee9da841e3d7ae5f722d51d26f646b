      "message": "Using let instead of var is better, although this is working code, so I\u0027m fine with it.\n\nThe scoping rules between the two are different - it doesn\u0027t matter in this patch, but in general var is WEIRD so it\u0027s good to develop a habit of using let instead.\n\n(tl;dr - if you do:\n\n console.log(x)\n var x \u003d 5\n\nThe console log will print \"undefined\" because for strange reasons javascript decides to scope var x to the entire surrounding block.\n\nlet works like we expect variables to work from python:\n\n  console.log(x)\n  let x \u003d 5\n\nresults in an error of x not being defined - because x isn\u0027t defined until it is when you use let.",

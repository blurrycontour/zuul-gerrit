I wonder if we could keep track of which pipelines are waiting for which semaphores (maybe a treecache?) and distribute the events only to those pipelines.",

      "message": "Yep, that should be \"significant\", otherwise there is point to have this change.\n\nThe idea to use a tree cache to check whether there are any pipelines waiting on a semaphore sound interesting, but maybe there would also be a way to know exactly which pipeline should receive the event (semaphore acquire priority). Usually when you have a semaphore in one pipeline it tends to stay there as long as there are other items waiting on the same semaphore.\n\nThe issue we observed was more due to a lot of semaphore release events leading to each one being send to all pipelines. This is also the reason for https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/942191",

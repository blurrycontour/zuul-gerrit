      "message": "I don\u0027t believe there is a code path that allows for the serialized JobData object to have a None value for its hash.  However, existing_job_data may itself be None, which is why we have the getattr (so that we don\u0027t raise an AttributeError).  I suppose it may be marginally more safe to add \"and job_data[\u0027hash\u0027] is not None\" onto the end, but it should not be possible to hit, so I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s worth it.",

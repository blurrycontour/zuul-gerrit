      "message": "Sorry, I was trying to convey that the in-repo semaphore would cause a configuration error which means that the config object would not be loaded; therefore any jobs that referenced that semaphore name would get the global one.\n\nIn other words, if you start with an in-repo semaphore \"foo\" and use it in jobs, then add a global semaphore \"foo\" then as soon as you do that, you get a config error and also the jobs continue to run but using the global semaphore.",

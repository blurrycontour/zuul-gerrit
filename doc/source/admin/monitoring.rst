Statsd reporting
----------------

Zuul comes with support for the statsd protocol, when enabled and configured
(see below), the Zuul scheduler will emit raw metrics to a statsd receiver
which let you in turn generate nice graphics.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Statsd support uses the ``statsd`` python module.  Note that support
is optional and Zuul will start without the statsd python module
present.

Configuration is in the :attr:`statsd` section of ``zuul.conf``.

Metrics
~~~~~~~

These metrics are emitted by the Zuul :ref:`scheduler`:

.. stat:: gerrit.event.<type>
   :type: counter

   Gerrit emits different kinds of messages over its `stream-events`
   interface.  Zuul will report counters for each type of event it
   receives from Gerrit.

   Refer to your Gerrit installation documentation for a complete
   list of Gerrit event types.

.. stat:: zuul.pipeline

   Holds metrics specific to jobs. This hierarchy includes:

   .. stat:: <pipeline name>

      A set of metrics for each pipeline named as defined in the Zuul
      config.

      .. stat:: all_jobs
         :type: counter

         Number of jobs triggered by the pipeline.

      .. stat:: current_changes
         :type: gauge

         The number of items currently being processed by this
         pipeline.

      .. stat:: job

         Subtree detailing per jobs statistics:

         .. stat:: <jobname>

            The triggered job name.

            .. stat:: <result>
               :type: counter, timer

               A counter for each type of result (e.g., ``SUCCESS`` or
               ``FAILURE``, ``ERROR``, etc.) for the job.  If the
               result is ``SUCCESS`` or ``FAILURE``, Zuul will
               additionally report the duration of the build as a
               timer.

      .. stat:: resident_time
         :type: timer

         A timer metric reporting how long each item has been in the
         pipeline.

      .. stat:: total_changes
         :type: counter

         The number of changes processed by the pipeline since Zuul
         started.

      .. stat:: wait_time
         :type: timer

         How long each item spent in the pipeline before its first job
         started.

      .. stat:: <project>

         This hierarchy holds more specific metrics for each project
         participating in the pipeline.  If the project name contains
         a ``/`` character, it will be replaced with a ``.``.

         .. stat:: current_changes
            :type: gauge

            The number of items of this project currently being
            processed by this pipeline.

         .. stat:: resident_time
            :type: timer

            A timer metric reporting how long each item for this
            project has been in the pipeline.

         .. stat:: total_changes
            :type: counter

            The number of changes for this project processed by the
            pipeline since Zuul started.

As an example, given a job named `myjob` triggered by the `gate` pipeline
which took 40 seconds to build, the Zuul scheduler will emit the following
statsd events:

  * ``zuul.pipeline.gate.job.myjob.SUCCESS`` +1
  * ``zuul.pipeline.gate.job.myjob``  40 seconds
  * ``zuul.pipeline.gate.all_jobs`` +1

Bitbucket Server
================

The Bitbucket Server driver supports sources. It is primarily intended
to interact with Bitbucket Server instances, i.e. not useful for the
Bitbucket Cloud offering.

Configure Bitbucket Server
--------------------------

You need to generate a user on Bitbucket that can read and write all
relevant projects and repositories. Furthermore you need to
register a SSH keypair for this user and distribute it to your
Zuul nodes.

Connection configuration
------------------------

The Bitbucket Server source will connect to a Bitbucket Server instance
via a named user. The options for the ``zuul.conf`` connections are:

.. attr:: <bitbucket connection>

  .. attr:: driver
    :required:

    .. value:: bitbucket

      The connection requires ``driver=bitbucket`` for Bitbucket Server
      connections.

  .. attr:: baseurl
    :required:

    The base URL of the Bitbucket API. E.g. ``https://bitbucket.foo.test``

  .. attr:: cloneurl

    The base URL of the Bitbucket GIT. E.g. ``ssh://git@bitbucket.foo.test:5999``

  .. attr:: user
    :required:

    Username to log in to the server.

  .. attr:: password
    :required:

    Password for the user to log in to the server.

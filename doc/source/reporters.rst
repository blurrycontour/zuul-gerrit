:title: Reporters

Reporters
=========

Zuul can communicate results and progress back to configurable
protocols. For example, after succeeding in a build a pipeline can be
configured to post a positive review back to Gerrit.

There are three stages when a report can be handled. That is on:
Start, Success or Failure. Each stage can have multiple reports.
For example, you can set verified on Gerrit and send an email.

Fedmsg
------

fedmsg (FEDerated MeSsaGe bus) is a brokerless messaging architecture
to send and receive messages to and from applications.  For more information
we encourage you to read about it at http://www.fedmsg.com/.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the fedmsg driver must be supplied to the
trigger.

Fedmsg Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

fedmsg has its own configuration management system. As a result, fedmsg
configuration should be added into the /etc/fedmsg.d folder. Specific settings
can be found in the fedmsg documentation
http://www.fedmsg.com/en/latest/config/#module-fedmsg.config

Each pipeline can define a separate topic to publish messages. EG::

  pipelines:
    - name: post-merge
      manager: IndependentPipelineManager
      source: my_gerrit
      trigger:
        my_gerrit:
          - event: change-merged
      success:
        fedmsg:
          topic: public
      failure:
        fedmsg:
          topic: private


Gerrit
------

Zuul works with standard versions of Gerrit by invoking the
``gerrit`` command over an SSH connection.  It reports back to
Gerrit using SSH.

The dictionary passed to the Gerrit reporter is used for ``gerrit
review`` arguments, with the boolean value of ``true`` simply
indicating that the argument should be present without following it
with a value. For example, ``verified: 1`` becomes ``gerrit review
--verified 1`` and ``submit: true`` becomes ``gerrit review
--submit``.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the gerrit driver must be supplied to the
trigger.

SMTP
----

A simple email reporter is also available.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the smtp driver must be supplied to the
reporter.

SMTP Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zuul.conf contains the SMTP server and default to/from as described
in :ref:`zuulconf`.

Each pipeline can overwrite the ``subject`` or the ``to`` or ``from`` address by
providing alternatives as arguments to the reporter. For example, ::

  pipelines:
    - name: post-merge
      manager: IndependentPipelineManager
      source: my_gerrit
      trigger:
        my_gerrit:
          - event: change-merged
      success:
        outgoing_smtp:
          to: you@example.com
      failure:
        internal_smtp:
          to: you@example.com
          from: alternative@example.com
          subject: Change {change} failed

SQL
---

This reporter is used to store results in a database.

A :ref:`connection` that uses the sql driver must be supplied to the
reporter.

SQL Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

zuul.conf contains the database connection and credentials. To store different
reports in different databases you'll need to create a new connection per
database.

The sql reporter is used to store the results from individual builds rather
than the change. As such the sql reporter does nothing on "start" or
"merge-failure".

**score**
  A score to store for the result of the build. eg: -1 might indicate a failed
  build similar to the vote posted back via the gerrit reporter.

For example ::

  pipelines:
    - name: post-merge
      manager: IndependentPipelineManager
      source: my_gerrit
      trigger:
        my_gerrit:
          - event: change-merged
      success:
        mydb_conn:
            score: 1
      failure:
        mydb_conn:
            score: -1

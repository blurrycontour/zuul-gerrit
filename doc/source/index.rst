Zuul - A Project Gating System
==============================

Zuul is a program that drives continuous integration, delivery, and
deployment systems with a focus on project gating and interrelated
projects.

Zuul's documentation is organized in three guides based on audience.
If Zuul is being used to gate or drive automation around your project,
read the :doc:`user/index` to find out how to configure Zuul.  If you
are installing or operating a Zuul system, you will also find the
:doc:`admin/index` useful.  If you want help make Zuul itself better,
take a look at the :doc:`developer/index`.

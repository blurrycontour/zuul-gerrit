Zool - A Project Gating System
==============================

Zool is a program that drives continuous integration, delivery, and
deployment systems with a focus on project gating and interrelated
projects.

Zool's documentation is organized in three guides based on audience.
If Zool is being used to gate or drive automation around your project,
read the :doc:`user/index` to find out how to configure Zool.  If you
are installing or operating a Zool system, you will also find the
:doc:`admin/index` useful.  If you want help make Zool itself better,
take a look at the :doc:`developer/index`.

      "message": "Considering this appears to be a \"private\" result dict entry is there a good reason to set the cacheable state here rather than on the task we run? I guess because setting it on the task we run means we cache the result of the task not the facts?\n\nI wonder if we should set fact as a second task and set it to be cacheable instead to be a bit more future proof.",

      "message": "Doing anything in ansible requires the use of private attributes, (see _templar) so the tail has lost its taboo for me.\n\nIf they do ever change this, the tests will fail since we rely on reading it from the cache, and we can correct it then.  In the meanwhile, it\u0027s one less task to deal with, and we avoid sending a potentially multi-megabyte dictionary through unecessary jinja templating, so I think it\u0027s worth it.",

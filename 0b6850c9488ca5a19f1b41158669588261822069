      "message": "I think this may introduce a race. getJobData() always looks at the last entry of the gearman Job\u0027s data list. The gear lib simply appends each WORK_DATA packet that it receives to this list.\n\nWhat this means is if the executor client receives the previous WORK_DATA with worker_hostname in it then receives this WORK_DATA with url in it before processing the first WORK_DATA response the client will only see the url work data and not see the worker_hostname data. It will then fail in Worker.updateFromData().\n\nTo address this I think we can simply continue to provide the old data here as well then the most recent WORK_DATA entry will include as much info as possible.",

I don\u0027t know that that is worth an edit to the comment above. But it might be confusing from a data perspective if inspecting the data directly because the patchset value in the key wouldn\u0027t match the patchset value within the change value itself?",

It might help if you could be more explicit about which attribute you mean by \"the current patchset value\"?\n\nI don\u0027t believe we will ever update GerritChange.patchset to point to a different value than the key (if they key has a patchset).  The only time we set that value is if it is unset, so we will not update the change for a key where patchset\u003d1 to say it\u0027s patchset 2.  The only things we will change are which patchsets dependencies point to (the main part of this change) and whether the patchset is current with GerritChange.is_current_patchset.  That last one might be wrong in the ssh case but is not important in the cases that it is.",

      "message": "Actually, that brings me back to the initial problem.\n\nWhen I changed the name of the streaming file name in I199313e1fff567b176020ced1d8e92c5059012cd, it was not working because the command.py would write it out to \"zuul-console-*\" but the extant zuul_console process was looking for \"console-*\".\n\nSo I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s valid to test command.py from the Zuul checkout against executor\u0027s version of zuul_console, as they share assumptions?",

Making an interface change between it and the console plugin (or callback plugin) should take that into account.  This job failing was (accidentally?) showing us that problem.",

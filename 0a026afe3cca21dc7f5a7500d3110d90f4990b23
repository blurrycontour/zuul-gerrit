      "message": "Just a note: We should still make sure the build is canceled in the future, even if the mechanism is different.  However it happens, we don\u0027t want it running after this point since it\u0027s effectively orphaned.\n\nAn actual concern: I think semaphores may not be handled in the case a pipeline or tenant is removed.  This method shares some code with scheduler.cancelJob, and that does return semaphores.  Perhaps we could use that instead of this?  Or otherwise somehow merge this code path?",

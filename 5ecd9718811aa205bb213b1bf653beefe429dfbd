      "message": "I have something in mind that you shouldn\u0027t alter \"global\" objects (or objects/variables outside of the action\u0027s scope) in redux actions, but I could be totally wrong here and mix it up with something else. I haven\u0027t worked with redux for a longer time now and aren\u0027t that deep into the topic anymore (which will hopefully change within the next weeks ;-) ).\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t see a problem with that and I see why we need this so I\u0027d say it\u0027s OK. But maybe we should have a look at that topic later on.\n\n@Jim: You might know redux better here and say it\u0027s OK. Then I\u0027m also fine with this ;-)",

      "message": "We definitely need to be careful about dealing with react components inside redux actions, but there\u0027s no problem updating global variables.  Since we need the API token (if set) now in *every* API call, there are a few ways of getting that.  Here\u0027s a blog post that summarizes them.  This approach is #3:\n\nhttps://daveceddia.com/access-redux-store-outside-react/#option-3-use-middleware-and-intercept-an-action\n\nI think we have way too many API calls and the call stack is too complex to try to pass the token around all the time.",

      "message": "I have something in mind that you shouldn\u0027t alter \"global\" objects (or objects/variables outside of the action\u0027s scope) in redux actions, but I could be totally wrong here and mix it up with something else. I haven\u0027t worked with redux for a longer time now and aren\u0027t that deep into the topic anymore (which will hopefully change within the next weeks ;-) ).\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t see a problem with that and I see why we need this so I\u0027d say it\u0027s OK. But maybe we should have a look at that topic later on.\n\n@Jim: You might know redux better here and say it\u0027s OK. Then I\u0027m also fine with this ;-)",

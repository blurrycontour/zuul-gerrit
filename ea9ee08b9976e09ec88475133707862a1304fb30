      "message": "My first thought is that I\u0027d rather not mix up such optional things with the Ansible version, as this is more or less independent from that. Also, I find a boolean flag catchier than encoding this into a version string. But that\u0027s just my five cents, I\u0027m open to other opinions there.\n\nAnyhow, there\u0027s still some problems with the zuul_console log streaming and the daemonizing/forking mechanism which needs to be addressed.",

But that\u0027s a big fat \"I think\"",

      "message": "I think it\u0027s out of scope for this spec - but fdegir has requested resumable executors before... he\u0027s got jobs that sometimes run for several days so an executor interruption is costly for him like a scheduler is for everyone. While I don\u0027t think we need to account for that in this spec - maybe it\u0027s worth noting that it could be a followup ... and executors over zookeeper are likely an important step towards being able to think about that.",

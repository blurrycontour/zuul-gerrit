      "message": "Nit:\nNodepool and zuul support defining the username in the nodepool config per image. I think we should use that as a best practice (expecially when using upstream cloud images with different distros).\n\nOff topic:\nI\u0027d even vote for deprecating the default_username as the username to use is an essential information that should be tied to an image in any case. What do you think about that?",

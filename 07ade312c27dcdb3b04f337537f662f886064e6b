We\u0027re going to use the zxid to compare a management event with the cache update time.  The management event will have its own zxid, so as long as cache \u003e event, cache is current.\n\nI looked ahead a bit, and it looks like that\u0027s exactly what you do in the following changes.  The only use of this feature is in the unit tests.  Maybe we could just make this a utility method in the test framework and omit it here?

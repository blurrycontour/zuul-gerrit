      "message": "Hi,\n\nI have created a dedicated yaml attribute as requested. However, the unit test `test_circular_dependencies.TestGerritCircularDependencies.test_cross_tenant_cycle` fails now for py311 and passes for py312. After staring at it for quite a while, I do not know how my addition could have possibly caused that.\n\nAlso, I am sure I would have to create unit tests for my new attribute. Are `unit/test_model.py` and `unit/test_scheduler.py` the correct place to do this?",

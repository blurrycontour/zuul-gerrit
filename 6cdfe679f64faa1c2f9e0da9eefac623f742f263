When making a change like this which doesn\u0027t appear to be strictly necessary, it\u0027s a good practice to include your reasoning in the commit message.  Like \"we can remove the secondary merger from test_branch_deletion because...\".\n\nHowever, I don\u0027t think we can.  I used git blame to look for the original reasoning for this, and the reason is mentioned in the commit message.  See da5bb7eea65776ea7f953ae1476e06d9062eaaab\n\nOf course, it should also have been a code comment, but we deal with what we have.\n\nI think you should restructure this to keep the secondary merger (while disabling the executor merger).  I think you have done that in other tests.",

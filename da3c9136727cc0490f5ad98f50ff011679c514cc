      "message": "I don\u0027t remember the details, but I believe this needs to be created before tests start, but then we make it active during the tests.\n\nBut this has made me realize we probably want a stop() in a teardown method.  That\u0027s what we do in nodepool for the aws driver.  Also, I just noticed that in nodepool we\u0027re missing a stop for one of the mocks (we have it for 2/3).  I\u0027ll fix that too.",

These are very small znodes, and the typical number is 4, and the identifiers are persistent.  So in practice I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be worth the complexity to clean up.",

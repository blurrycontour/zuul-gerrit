      "message": "Some minor things inline. I like the spec on the whole. The way the problems are described at the beginning leads the reader to the solution which is nice.\n\nOne thing I do wonder about is if we need to add more warning signs around using these features? Maybe something to consider after the spec is implemented, but the complexity described in this document is a good indication for why this is complicated and humans have a hard time with complexity. I worry that we\u0027ll continue to find edge cases where people are surprised. This refactor does seem like a good place to tackle those problems from though.",

      "message": "Something that just occurred to me and consider this brainstorming and not an endorsement:\n\nOne feature that some other CI systems support is the idea of batching changes automatically to conserve resources. This has the downsides of losing bisect-ability, but may be useful to some users. I think this spec\u0027s treatment of queue items potentially makes that possible with a new pipeline manager. One that collects events and acts on them on some time period creating a zuul specific bundele not represented in the code review system. I don\u0027t think we need to solve that here or ever if the need doesn\u0027t arise but it is cool that I think this spec makes that much easier to implement.",

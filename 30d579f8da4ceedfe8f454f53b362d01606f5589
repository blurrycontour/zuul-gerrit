      "message": "Some minor things inline. I like the spec on the whole. The way the problems are described at the beginning leads the reader to the solution which is nice.\n\nOne thing I do wonder about is if we need to add more warning signs around using these features? Maybe something to consider after the spec is implemented, but the complexity described in this document is a good indication for why this is complicated and humans have a hard time with complexity. I worry that we\u0027ll continue to find edge cases where people are surprised. This refactor does seem like a good place to tackle those problems from though.",

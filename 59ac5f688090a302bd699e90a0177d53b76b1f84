And hopefully we\u0027ve found all of those.  :)\n\nBut if we do, right now an operator can recover from that by restarting; but they won\u0027t have the option in the future.\n\nSince this naming system makes it easy to determine if a semaphore lock is still valid, let\u0027s add this to the periodic cleanup we were talking about earlier:\n\nPeriodically check that every semaphore holder still exists, and if not, delete it and log an error message.",

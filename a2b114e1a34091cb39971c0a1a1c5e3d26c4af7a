      "message": "Re namespacing: exactly so.\n\nRe safe: this appears to be correct because we don\u0027t url quote the event queues, but we do url quote the pipeline state.  Since they have different roots (/zuul/event vs /zuul), they do have a different risk exposure there, but I suspect there may be a lurking potential problem with the event queues.  We should probably put something on our backlog to look into that.",

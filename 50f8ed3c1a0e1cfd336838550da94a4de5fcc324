      "message": "Note, this appears to keep a commit but without changes. If you run `git show HEAD` after this operation you have a commit message with no diff. This is different than the git merge case which simply exits 0 and reports `Already up to date.`\n\nFor many users this might be fine. But if you use git repo state to calculate versioning for example this could be a problem.\n\nA better solution with fewer side effects may be to avoid merging anything in the case of change-merged/ref-updated events and simply checkout the state of the system at that point in time? I haven\u0027t dug in to see what would be involved in doing that, but would avoid problematic side effects in the git tree.",

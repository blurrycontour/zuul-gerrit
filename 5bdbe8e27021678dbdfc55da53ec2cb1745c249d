      "message": "While it may not be true to our CI setup but is quite common for doc building to not run under tox (readthedocs does this).\n\nFor example I am currently using tox v4 and building docs with it will fail due to missing tox executable (it is called tox4 until it is released). Even after it is released `tox -va` will not longer work, as it would become `tox list`.\n\nIMHO, declaring the fact that `tox` is required in order to successfully build the docs is not a mistake, as we do need to run `tox -va` to build the docs. In fact it would be correct to put `tox\u003c4` to be fully correct.",

I might be missing something about how this is intended to work though.\n\nIf a project currently holds a zuul.conf with various different scenarios for different branches, and then a stable/* branch is created all of a sudden those other jobs will match.\n\nIs the intention here to enforce projects to have a zuul.conf per branch thus superseding the \u0027branches\u0027 directive? Is the \u0027branches\u0027 directive then only used for the more centrally defined job parameters?\n\nEither way this magic changing could be quite confusing to users.. perhaps we should rethink having \u0027branches\u0027 at all.",

      "message": "The _source_branch attribute is only set for project repos, not config repos, so this only affects project repos.\n\nI believe that a user will expect that if the nova project has a .zuul.yaml file in a given branch, it will describe the tests which should run in that branch.  And yes, a project should have a .zuul.yaml in every branch in which it is relevant.  That will happen naturally because of the way branching happens.\n\nAnd yes, the \u0027branches\u0027 directive is more relevant for centrally defined jobs.  I think it is still required for that.",

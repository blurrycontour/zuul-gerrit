      "message": "Perhaps that could be solved by using another store, it seems like we could create it with another react-redux Provider in the App, e.g. after the oidc configuration is known.\n\nAlternatively we could also check if there is a conflict with the state variable name.\n\nThough this may not be a big deal, and we could address that particular issue in a follow-up, to avoid delaying the current stack.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve looked into using several stores, but everything I\u0027ve seen advised against doing that. Granted, we seem to allow something bad already, so \"in for a penny ...\"\n\nI am going to take this opportunity to look into other libraries. Now that I am more at ease with react and redux, it might be easier to use other libs than I previously thought. That\u0027d be ideal too since redux-oidc seems to be dead (lots of issues on GH without answers in the last year).",

# zuul-client pins to requests==1.24.0 which is incompatible
# with urllib >= 1.26.0.  We can not simply remove that pin
# in zuul-client because it runs the zuul-client-zuul-functional
# job, which runs a tox environment.  Our tox role first installs
# everything without tests, before installing siblings.  This means
# it tries to install the released zuul-client first; ignoring any
# changes to the requirements that might be in the change.
# By pinning urllib3 here we can get that test working, which
# allows us to merge the removal to zuul-client.

If you\u0027re looking for a way to incorporate the words \"build server\" into the page, maybe add it to the node entry like, \"This is what a typical Zuul deployment would use for builds, in place of a classic build server.\"",

It acts on node requests made by the Zuul scheduler, and takes care of booting nodes as needed to fulfil these requests, deleting them again if necessary once Zuul releases its lock to indicate they\u0027re no longer in use.",

The second would be to just don\u0027t care about this in the package and let zuul handle the installations (e.g. use /var/lib/zuul/executor-ansible/...).\n\nIn case of zuul-managed installations my thought was that zuul will update all installations on startup and thus automatically handle security updates by restart. In the other case of unmanaged ansible installations it\u0027s of course the task of the deployer/packager to take care of this.\n\nRegarding one ansible version per executor, I\u0027m opposed to this idea because this will complicate the job scheduling and make deployment much more complicated compared to supporting all versions at once by each executor.",

So we can support both \"have your installation machinery run it\" as well as \"have it happen automatically on startup\".\n\nHowever, to directly answer the question, wearing my openstack-infra hat: if we had to run the script after installation and before startup, that would be fine.  It would be easy to do that in puppet, and, honestly, I\u0027d probably prefer that to having it happen automatically (as I could know that it succeeded before I restarted any processes).",

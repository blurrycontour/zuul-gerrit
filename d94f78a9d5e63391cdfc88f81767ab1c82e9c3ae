Have you traced through all of the possibilities?\n\nThe only place where I\u0027m finding executeJobs() being used is in _processOneItem() to determine whether to set changed\u003dT/F - subsequent to that it doesn\u0027t appear to alter the immediate control flow (changed is only further modified or returned)\n\n_processOneItem() appears to be only used in processQueue() and the return value alters \u0027queue_changed\u0027, which appears to have some impact on debug logging and and cause the return value of processQueue() to return T/F\n\nprocessQueue()\u0027s return value appears impact whether or not the while-loop in Scheduler#_process_pipeline() (scheduler.py) continues or exits \n\ntl;dr yes, I\u0027ve looked through.  Currently the only value returned by executeJobs() are falsy, but it appears that maybe that\u0027s bad?",

      "message": "Reading these docs the way they get organized a level up is such that we configure the unit files for the services then enable and start the services below before the pip installation for nodepool and zuul is done.\n\nMaybe what we want is a first step distro specific bootstrapping and it can have all the stuff above in it (so docs on how to get python and bindep and zookeeper working). Then docs on installing the python things. Then a service management (systemd, etc) section which will likely just start as systemd only to begin.",

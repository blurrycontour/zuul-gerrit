      "message": "Setting the severity here makes all of the text a sort of rust color which has two problems: not all of the text is necessarily an error, and it reduces the contrast, making it harder to read.  I could see applying a line-by-line highlighter here, but I don\u0027t think we should apply a color to all of the text.",

Some log files with long lines are much easier to read if the lines are not wrapped.

We could do something like this:\n\n  if build.result \u003d\u003d \u0027FAILURE\u0027:\n      self._handleAutoHold(build)\n\nThat way we can check first for a failed build and don\u0027t have to pay the iteration over the autohold requests for all builds. Further this would make reading this method easier.",

      "message": "The description of the command above says it will lock the tenant-pipeline and then completely delete the pipeline state. Here we are only locking the tenant but with a write lock. I think that means we have exclusive lock over all pipelines for the tenant thus this is ok?\n\nIn the scheduler we lock pipelines separately while holding a tenant read lock.",

      "message": "I guess this allows us to avoid needing to create a pipeline object too when creating the state for deletion. It does seem a bit hacky to tack on some additional attributes just for this use case though.\n\nIt looks like creating a pipeline only needs a name and a tenant and with that pipelinePath() below is ablow to return a proper path. Is there another reason to avoid creating the extra object?",

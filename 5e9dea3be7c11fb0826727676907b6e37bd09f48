      "message": "We can also segment it if necessary.  /zuul/config/project/branch/jobs/ could be a directory of json blobs.  We wouldn\u0027t need to make one zobject per job -- we would end up with too many zobjects that way.  But we could have /zuul/config/project/branch/jobs/1 be the first 100 jobs, and jobs/2 be the next 100.  That way we remove the size limitation, and when small changes happen in big repos, we reduce the amount of data we need to change in zk (for example, we might only replace the jobs/2 object if job #157 is updated).",

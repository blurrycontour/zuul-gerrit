      "message": "If a change was in a queue, and a draft was published, that suggests that zuul had access to the change in its draft state.  In that case, I\u0027m not certain that a draft should cause a dequeue.\n\nIn fact, even if a change is uploaded as a draft, I believe that gerrit emits the patchset-created event, which _is_ the thing that should cause a draft to be dequeued.",

      "message": "Ok,  I was confused.  I thought the draft-publish event occurs when a draft patch gets pushed to gerrit (i.e. git push origin HEAD:refs/drafts/master) that\u0027s why I thought it should cause a dequeue.\n\nYou are right, pushing a draft only triggers the patchset-created event, not the draft-publish event.   The draft publish event only occurs when users push the \"publish\" button for the change (in the gerrit UI).  In this case I agree that a dequeue should not happen.",

      "message": "For potential followup, the code might be easier to grok/modify if the control flow was tied more directly to the watchdog existing and less the timeout. Something like:\n\n  watchdog \u003d None\n  if timeout:\n      watchdog \u003d Watchdog()\n      watchdog.start()\n  try:\n      ...\n  finally:\n      watchdog and watchdog.stop()\n  ...\n  if watchdog and watchdog.timed_out:\n     ...\n\nBut it so minimally different I don\u0027t know that its actually valuable, just noticed that we have tightly coupled timeout being a thing with watchdog being a thing rather than just checkingdirectly.",

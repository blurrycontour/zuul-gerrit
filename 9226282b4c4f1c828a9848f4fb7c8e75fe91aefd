      "message": "Assuming no test runs for more than 24 hours (maybe this is a bad assumption. You could set the format string to \"%H:%M:%S\" then you would get the time delta as time since the epoch. It should work given my assumption.\n\nAlso, as I think about it I don\u0027t like variable time formats. I am afraid it will confuse our users and they won\u0027t know if the MM:SS is hours and minutes or minutes and seconds. If we stick to HH:MM:SS it will be consistent and help prevent confusion.",

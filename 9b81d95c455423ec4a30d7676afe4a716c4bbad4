I think saying \"not be met\" is pontentially confusing (that\u0027s why I used the word \"satisfied\" in the next sentence).\n\nIf we need to rework it, perhaps we should go with something like \"It describes conditions that when met will cause the event not to match.\"  And then likewise change the require sentence to \"It describes conditions that must be met in order for the event to match.\"",

      "message": "This part of the change is troubling.  It intentionally includes nodes which do not belong to this zuul, in order to count them and emit a stat called \"zuul.nodepool.resources\".  It\u0027s starting to seem like this should be a change to Nodepool instead of Zuul.\n\nWhy not keep the zuul_system filter which would make this \"nodepool resources allocated to this zuul tenant\",  or, move this to nodepool which would then be \"nodepool resources allocated to this nodepool tenant\"?",

It isn\u0027t clear why we treat them specially other than it is apparently only useful in this one scenario?\n\nAliases were introduced with this change https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/799127/3/zuul/executor/server.py and in the comments to that change its indicated the type of name being a string or a list of strings is confusing and the source of errors and should be changed.\n\nI\u0027m not sure I fully understand what the fix is though am happy to help if it can be articulated.",

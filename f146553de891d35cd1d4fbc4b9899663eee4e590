This is also the current behavior and I added a test for that as well.\n\nhttps://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/latest/tenants.html#attr-tenant.untrusted-projects.%3Cproject%3E.always-dynamic-branches",

      "message": "I think the documentation is incomplete, and that section should probably say something like \"only jobs which can be specified *in-repo*...\", because you can still specify that a job can run on a dynamic-only branch if you specify that in a config-project (and the test you wrote confirms that).\n\nI *think* this change is compatible though, because there are two cases:\n\n* post-merge job defined on dynamic branch -- ignored (as the docs currently indicate)\n* post-merge job defined in config-project -- runs as normal (not affected by this change because it\u0027s a static definition) (undocumented but presumably correct behavior)\n\nI think at this point I\u0027m satisfied that we\u0027re seeing the correct behavior in all related cases.

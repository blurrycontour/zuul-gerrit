However, upstream have added with [1] more complete documentation the return values [2] which also says that start/end/delta are *also* always returned.\n\nI think it\u0027s excusable that this was missed as that was added after this file branched (I didn\u0027t dig further, maybe there\u0027s more context).\n\nHowever, I think that justifies adding start and end values to this return as well, and we might as well do that all at once?\n\n[1] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/commit/b7fbc57227650a0aab05231bf245889f247484dd\n[2] https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/57f6abdb8460f8501eb9668004f4d7722bda5570/lib/ansible/modules/commands/command.py#L89",

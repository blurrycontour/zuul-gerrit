I think the work item details are probably more of an OpenDev thing and it\u0027s fine to leave the details out of this spec.  But if the outcome of this is \"The Zuul project would like to expand the OpenDev service to support this additional feature\" we should probably have at least one person who\u0027s willing to make that happen.",

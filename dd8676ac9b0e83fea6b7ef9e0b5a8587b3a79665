      "message": "I was just wondering why I used the queue here at all, because originally I intended to use the same parameters as the dequeue command in the zuul cli. So I looked up the other code place where the dequeue event is built from the external_id and I think that the \"queue\" here is just a leftover from testing as it\u0027s never evaluated. I will check that again and remove it if my assumption is correct.\n\nIn that case, I don\u0027t think we need add an additional uuid for the QueueItem here. Although it would simplify this part, we would need another lookup mechanism to find a QueueItem by its uuid. Unless there are other use cases for that I would not add this as the zuul cli dequeue also works without that additional id.",

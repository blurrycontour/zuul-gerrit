You\u0027ll note that I actually provided a link to the project-config document in the new doc and this new doc is really only a pretty directory listing. Perhaps you\u0027d rather I moved \u0027/project-config\u0027 to \u0027/config/index\u0027?",

      "message": "By \"navigate up\" you mean by editing the URL?  Or is there some navigation link that we have that is broken?  Because I can\u0027t seem to find a way to get to a directory listing by clicking links in the job.html page.\n\nI\u0027m not particularly concerned with providing index pages for directories that aren\u0027t accessible by hyperlink from within our docs, so I think the costs of making changes to this outweigh the benefits.\n\nYou might ask \"Why isn\u0027t job-config.html config/index.html?\"  The answer is that configuring jobs is just one small part of configuring Zuul, and config/index.html is a bit of a misnomer.  Perhaps it should have been job-config/index.html.\n\nIf this really bothers you and you would still like to change it, then here are my thoughts:\n\nWe should not create another page which appears to be a summary of project configuration because it may be confused with the existing one which provides important context.\n\nHere are some alternatives:\n\n1) Move project-config down a level as you suggest.  Be sure to update the redirect map in zuul/zuul-website (that should be a second change that depends-on this one and we should merge them simultaneously).\n\n2) Like #1 except also rename the config/ directory to job-config/.  That\u0027s probably what should have been done originally.  This needs a few more redirects in zuul-website.\n\n3) Just add a redirect from config/$ to project-config.html in zuul-website.\n\n4) Update this change so that config/index.html is a one liner that says \"See project-config\".\n\nI still don\u0027t really like #4 and would prefer #1 or #2, or #3.",

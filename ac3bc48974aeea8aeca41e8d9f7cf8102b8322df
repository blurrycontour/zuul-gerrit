      "message": "For the record, I think mutable defaults are fine in cases like this where we know the lifecycle of the variables.  I wouldn\u0027t have asked for this change.  But in general it\u0027s obviously better, so I don\u0027t object to it either.  Having said that, since the entire goal of this change is to avoid human programming errors, we should endeavor to avoid creating a new type of error by creating a wall of text that is difficult to read and verify.  How about we use this form instead:\n\nself._types \u003d types or []\n\nThat seems more readable to me and therefore easier to verify.",

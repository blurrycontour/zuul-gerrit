      "message": "I just came across this change and I like the idea to define those colours in a central place.\nHowever, I have the feeling that those are too many different colours (or too many different shades per color). I didn\u0027t check it out in detail though and will try to do that in the next days.\nIs there a reason why you went away from the PF4 CSS color constants? I was using them wherever possible to ensure that our colours harmonize with the PF4 design/components.",

      "message": "I wanted to give a unique color to each result, but it is true that that\u0027s a lot of dispersion, and besides, some colors are actually hard to distinguish depending on your display\u0027s configuration (and quality).\n\nI think that at the very least, we should assign one color by type of result, so that it is clearer whose attention is required to address a potential problem. I\u0027ve proposed this grouping below, and I\u0027d appreciate feedback from other folks about its pertinence.\n\nAlso note that while I\u0027m not using the CSS constants, the values *are* taken from the PF CSS palette, as is mentioned in the comments, see https://www.patternfly.org/v4/guidelines/colors/#color-palette - I\u0027m sure it\u0027s possible to use the constants but I\u0027m not very familiar with how to use styles, so any nudge in the right direction is welcome.",

      "message": "Regarding the variety of colours proposed in this patch:\nI think we should stick to a small amount of expressive colours which you could clearly differentiate rather than a lot of different colours with a variety of shades for two reasons:\n1. As Matthieu already mentioned those shades might be hard to distinguish depending on the display configuration and quality.\n2. IMHO the amount of colours is distracting from the actual result and depending on the combination of the results next to each other it might even become hard to distinguish between e.g. green and blue results.\n...There might be more reasons but those are the first two that came to my mind.\n\nI would stick to the colours we have so far as they correspond very well to each other and also to the overall PF4 design (actually they are taken from other PF4 components and more or less reflect the main colours used for e.g. success and warning icons/buttons, progress bars and other parts). I assume that the PF4 developers took quite some time to come up with those colours and I find them a very good match. Those are\n\n- green: --pf-global--success-color--100 (--pf-global--palette--green-500)\n- red: --pf-global--danger-color--100 (--pf-global--palette--red-100)\n- blue: --pf-global--info-color--100 (--pf-global--palette--blue-300)\n- yellow: --pf-global--warning-color--100 (--pf-global--palette--gold-400)\n\nWe could then think about adding one different colous to e.g. highlight infrastructure errors, but I wouldn\u0027t add more colours. We should also keep in mind that non-voting builds are greyed out so we should avoid using anything \"greyish\" as colour for a build result.\n\nIn the current implementation we use the following \"categories\" (as I came up with the mapping I\u0027ve also added a few notes):\n\nSUCCESS -\u003e green (The one-and-only \"everything is fine\" result)\nFAILURE, RETRY_LIMIT -\u003e red (To me those were the two \"final\" failure results which might not directly be related to infrastructure or something else).\nSKIPPED -\u003e blue\nABORTED, CANCELED, RETRY and all other \"known\" failures reasons -\u003e yellow (This is kind of the \"remaining results\" category where I put in everything else). IMHO this category would be a good starting point if we want to revise some categories. \n\nI think it might be worth to revise some of the \"categories\" and move certain results into another category, but I wouldn\u0027t change too much about this.",

I wouldn\u0027t consider the current bundle to be a duplicate and this method now behaves differently depending on the pipeline type (in dependent pipelines it\u0027s a list with only the current bundle and in independent pipelines it is a list of other bundles **excluding** the current bundle).\n\nThe other option might be to rename this method and always return also the current bundle.",

      "message": "The intention is to replace lines 5647--5653 which always need this.  Since we\u0027re using this in more places, all the call sites would need those lines as well, so I moved it into the method.\n\nI agree the name is slightly misleading, but I\u0027d rather keep it because it shows up when I search for duplicate.  There\u0027s a nice symmetry to findDuplicate(Job|Bundle).\n\nMaybe findIdenticalBundles and findIdenticalJobs would be better (depending on one\u0027s understanding of the identity property)?\n\nFor me though, it doesn\u0027t seem like much of an improvement.  We do have a comment explaining the weird behavior.",

      "message": "Name of the method aside I\u0027m wondering if we could at least keep the behavior the same and return `self.bundle` with the list of other related bundles for non-dependent pipelines. In the changes to the manager\u0027s `_getItemsWithBuild()` we are currently explicitly adding our own builds, so that could even be removed. But maybe there would be problems in `findDuplicateJob()` due to that change.\n\nChanging my vote to a +2 since this is not a hill to die on.",

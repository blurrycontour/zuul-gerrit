We have generally assumed quite a large range of permitted actions from config repos, but already have an `allowed-triggers` tenant config option to restrict what pipelines can do.  Since this is proposed as an enhancement to the `zuul` trigger, that alone isn\u0027t sufficient; we may need to augment that with something like `allowed-zuul-events` or maybe just a boolean `allow-image-builds`.  With that, we can prevent people from adding image builds to pipelines in certain tenants.\n\nHaving said that, I personally think this would be a boon even for opendev to allow tenants to manage their own images.  Most of opendev\u0027s images should be common and built in the opendev tenant, but I could see the utility of tenant-specific images.\n\nPlus with the ability to use job inheritance, we could tune our caching situation a bit better (eg, devstack images are built from a child job that just caches some more blobs).",

We usually use \"upgrade\" for telling people about actions which may need to be performed in order to upgrade, but this is disabled by default, so people will get the current behavior unless they opt-in to the new feature.  Similarly, \"security\" is usually where we let people know about vulnerabilities, but since this is disabled by default, there won\u0027t be any at this point.",

      "message": "We actually perform a smart reconfiguration event on startup of schedulers[1].  If there is a change to the tenant configuration (adding/removing projects/tenants), then those tenants should be reconfigured automatically.  However, if a change to in-repo zuul config was merged while all schedulers were offline, then a full or tenant reconfiguration would be needed in order for that to take effect.\n\nIt\u0027s not clear which thing you\u0027re trying to address here; if you have observed the first behavior in contradiction to what I wrote, we should look into that since it sounds like a bug.  If it\u0027s the second thing you want to communicate, then maybe we should elaborate a bit on this to make that clear.\n\n[1] https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul/src/branch/master/zuul/scheduler.py#L918-L925",

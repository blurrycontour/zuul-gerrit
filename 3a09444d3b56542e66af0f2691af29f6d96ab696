We do choose to use podman in CI in order to get speculative containers, but this should work with any docker-compatible backend.  I think it may even work with a systemd user socket, so this may work with rootless podman.  I haven\u0027t tested that, and that\u0027s not something we\u0027re aiming for in opendev either (I think in opendev, some of the remaining issues we had with podman were when running rootless).",

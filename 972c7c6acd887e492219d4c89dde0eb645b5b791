      "message": "I\u0027m fine with this change, but as a note: I don\u0027t see a reason for waiting for config priming in the run handler. Without waiting for config priming the scheduler can already start processing loaded tenants.\n\nThis shouldn\u0027t be a problem as the tenant is only added to the abide after it is *fully* loaded. Also, the priming/reconfig is protected by the read-write lock so there should be no way a scheduler attempts processing a partially loaded tenant.",

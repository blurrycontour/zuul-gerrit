      "message": "Yes, the ZooKeeperComponentRegistry#all will return ZooKeeperComponentReadOnly. The reason is that components can read other components but only the component which called the ZooKeeperComponentRegistry#register method will get a r/w access. This makes it easier to cache values (one does not have to check what is the state in ZK) and enables better prevention that a component changes attributes which it does not own.",

      "message": "Not sure if I like the usage of __setitem__ here. It makes using the ZooKeeperComponent a little misleading IMHO since it looks like a dict but doesn\u0027t work like a dict in all occasions (e.g. when using len() or an iterator).\n\nI like the idea of directly updating the value of the znode when an attribute changes, but I think this could also be achieved by defining custom methods like `get()` and `set()` which don\u0027t imply any dictionary magic. IMHO this would make the usage of this class a little more explicit.\n\nI don\u0027t see this as a blocker and leave this comment up for discussion.",

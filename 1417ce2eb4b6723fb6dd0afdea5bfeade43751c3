      "message": "The two template vars apply to all jobs running against a project is slightly unintuitive. I would expect them to only apply against the jobs in the template. I\u0027m not sure that this is the correct behavior (it is a project-template afterall), just the more intuitive one (for me at least).",

      "message": "yeah, I tried to make this clear in the latest revision of the docs where it says that \"template vars are merged into the project vars where they\u0027re included\".  I feel like the merging is \"zuul-ish\" behaviour; in a similar way that the other parts of the template are being merged into your current project (jobs are merged together, etc)",

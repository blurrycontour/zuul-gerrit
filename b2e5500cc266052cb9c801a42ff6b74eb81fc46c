A lot of common libraries have a base name \"dummy package\" they provide in the package metadata so you could use something like just libre2 here and get the available/default version of it on each platform. Unfortunately the libre2-* packages don\u0027t do this. :/",

I also did not update the \"simulated user key\" that the test playbook creates for performing the user actions against Gerrit.

Since we scheduled the first merge job when the item first entered the pipeline, and we have no other way of knowing if the change can still merge unless we schedule a second merge job, I think we need to schedule two merges per item. This is less than ideal, but I think it\u0027s needed in order to report merge conflicts before the item is actionable -- which is very useful when queue times are over an hour.",

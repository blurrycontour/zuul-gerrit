      "message": "To be honest I\u0027m not super thrilled about leaving that undefined. Would it be possible to fail the job if a pre-fail was detected?\n\nI\u0027m mainly concerned about what an \u0027gate\u0027 pipeline manager will do with an item where all jobs succeeded, but the item was moved out-of-line already. Will the change be merged in that case? Looking at `QueueItem.didAllJobsSucceed()`, `QueueItem.isBundleFailing()`, `QueueItem.hasAnyJobFailed()` and the use of those methods, the answer might be \"yes\".\n\nI think there is some truth to the saying \"when you try to solve a problem with a regex you\u0027ve got two problems\". Considering that regex might not be easy to get 100% right, I think we should make this case \"safe\" to fail for the users.",

      "message": "Maybe add the new queue_name parameter too?  Or maybe not:\n\nIf the name of the queue changes during a reconfiguration, then this result event could get lost.  I think the additional time savings of iterating over all changes in a pipeline vs just the queue in order to find the buildset isn\u0027t worth the complexity of dealing with that situation.  Maybe we should keep this simple and omit the queue_name for now.  Once everything is in ZK, if we still don\u0027t like that, we can add dictionary to speed things up.",

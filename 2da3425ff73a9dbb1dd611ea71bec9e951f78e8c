      "message": "This introduces a network round trip for all node requests in the pipeline in all pipeline runs (which can be a lot). I think this may have a noticeable impact on scheduling performance in our system.\n\nI think we usually only have to revise the priorities if some item we processed before changed in a way that requires this (I think that\u0027s only dequeued items and failed items in dependent pipelines). We could change processOneItem to return a flag if it did such a change and forward that to the next processOneItem call so we can skip this loop entirely if we don\u0027t need to revise node requests.",

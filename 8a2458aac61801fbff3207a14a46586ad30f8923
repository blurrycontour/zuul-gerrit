      "message": "In this case tenant-whatever doesn\u0027t actually exist so there is no auth config for that tenant. I think the correct thing to do in that situation is to return an authorization error instead of say a 404 to avoid disclosing too much info. However, should we have a test to ensure we get authorization failures back when the tenant does exist but with an auth config that doesn\u0027t give the testuser access?",

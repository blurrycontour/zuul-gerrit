If not, then we have the same awkward situation we have now, which is that you have to run zuul-web (the \"api\" server) and then map the static content into the uri space somehow.\n\nI\u0027d like this to be deployable as a self-contained application, so that if you wanted, you could just start zuul-web on port 80.  Or start it on 8000 and reverse proxy to it, with no rewrite rules or anything.",

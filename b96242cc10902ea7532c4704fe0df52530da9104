      "message": "A cat job that has no \u0027updated\u0027 should be treated the same as a failed cat job as it\u0027s essentially a failed cat job. So this makes it much more complicated than needed.\n\nFor the start we really should just treat it the same as a regularly failed cat job which should be as easy as modifying this if clause to:\n\n if not hasattr(job, \u0027updated\u0027) or not job.updated:\n     raise...\n\nIn a different change we can think about how we can handle failed cat jobs more gracefully. I think we should log an error and store this as a config error instead of raising an exception. But this might need deeper thoughts and more discussion and should be subject of a follow-up.",

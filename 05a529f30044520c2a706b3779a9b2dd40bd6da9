Otherwise, any existing entries in the cache will have this set to \"None\" and unless/until they get an update from gitlab, all those changes will be marked as being unable to merge.  And on projects that don\u0027t have the setting enabled, that will never happen, so any change Zuul has ever seen up to that point will be marked that way.",

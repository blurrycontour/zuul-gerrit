      "message": "I\u0027m concerned by the increase in these calls; but if we move the change cache into ZK, this should be reduced, right?\n\nDo you think it\u0027s okay to merge this change without the change cache in ZK ready to go?\n\nThere are some events where we get file listings right?  So this shouldn\u0027t affect every event, just events where we don\u0027t get files (because they are too large?).",

      "message": "With the change cache in Zookeeper we\u0027d still have those additional calls to getChange() but they\u0027d always hit the cache. I\u0027m thinking that at the current stage (only a single scheduler supported) it might make sense to remove `refresh\u003dTrue` in the event processing path as we know that the cache is up-to-date.\n\nWith the current implementation as-is, we are causing quite some extra load on the API endpoints (Github, ...).",

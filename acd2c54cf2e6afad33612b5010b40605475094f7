This is loaded as the fixture in tenant_config_file and then newer-than and the other patches in this series customize it with these files via updateConfigLayout.\n\nHonestly I never looked deeply into how that worked, it made sense to me that updateConfigLayout would update an existing layout and when it worked i didn\u0027t go any further.",

      "message": "I suspect we\u0027re looking at another manifestation of Story #2000804 where the job \"definition\" in a project-pipeline configuration is able to stand in for a normal job definition.  I think when we fix that, this should break as Paul expects.\n\nThe call to \u0027reconfigure()\u0027 should entirely replace the configuration (including dropping the project1-job and project2-job definitions from common-config), so I think their inclusion is a red herring.\n\nLet\u0027s go ahead and add the definitions for project1-job and project2-job to the newer-than repo so that this doesn\u0027t complicate the fix to 2000804, and I\u0027ve added a note on that story to make sure that we handle this case (assuming that it is related).",

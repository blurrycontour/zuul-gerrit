      "message": "Note for reviewers: the pipeline state that we change here locally is updated in Zookeeper either as a side-effect of e.g. queues being added/removed but at the latest when the pipeline state is set at the end of a pipeline run: https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul/src/branch/master/zuul/scheduler.py#L2232-L2233\n\nThe reason why this works is because the `_zkobject_hash` used for deciding whether to save the object or not, is calculated based on the original raw data from ZK.",

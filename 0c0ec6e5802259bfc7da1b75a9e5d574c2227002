      "message": "While reviewing how this all fits together I notice that we don\u0027t seem to expose the console log port as an option via the executor server command? The internal class object accepts the console port as an argument but nothing every sets it so we always use the default.\n\nNot sure if we want to try and expose that better? Or maybe those bits are just there to make testing simpler.",

      "message": "It\u0027s definitely not meant to be configurable.\n\nThere will still be times that files will be left behind (for instance, when a job is aborted).\n\nIf you really want to ensure proper cleanup, perhaps the console streaming daemon could act as a tmp reaper.  That might obviate the need for the protocol complexity (but it\u0027s nice to have a protocol anyway).",

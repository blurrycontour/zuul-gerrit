      "message": "Honestly it\u0027s really at your convenience, as long as we don\u0027t forget to do it. I\u0027d suggest to be done with it as soon as possible, and since I wouldn\u0027t consider this a major breakage introducing this with the next minor versions sounds fine to me.\n\nThere must be however enough time between the minor releases for operators to become aware of the deprecation - read the release notes, the doc, use zuul\u0027s zuul-client and see the warning - and act upon it if needed. So it really mainly depends on zuul\u0027s expected release velocity.",

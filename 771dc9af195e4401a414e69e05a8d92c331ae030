      "message": "I\u0027m not sure the word \u0027status\u0027 adds anything to these, I\u0027d consider dropping it; except we should have something before \u003cphase\u003e since it\u0027s so open-ended, and we may as well put setup and cleanup in the same bucket (they\u0027re very much like phases as well).  So how about replacing \u0027status\u0027 with \u0027phase\u0027 or \u0027run\u0027 or something like that for those 3 cases, and just dropping \u0027status\u0027 from merger?\n\nPlease include all of this info in the documentation.

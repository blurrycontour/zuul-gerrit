      "message": "We aren\u0027t just releasing the lock we are also short circuiting pipeline processing for the tenant. Would it be better to log this as:\n\n  self.log.debug(\"Stopping tenant %s pipeline processing in order to release the tenant read lock.\", tenant.name)\n\nSeparately checking the contenders will involve ZK traffic. I expect that compared to long waits for the lock this is preferable but calling that out in case it represents a problem.",

ZK traffic: yep, this needs a few ZK requests, but as there shouldn\u0027t be too many contenders at any given time I think it won\u0027t have a significant performance impact.",

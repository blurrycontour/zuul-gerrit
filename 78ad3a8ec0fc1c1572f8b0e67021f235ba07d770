I would recommend adding it to the \"bugfix\" section and say something like:\n\n  The `labels` pipeline requirement in the `gitlab` driver erroneously treated the labels as a boolean `or` but should have treated them as a boolean `and` (i.e., all listed labels are required).  The behavior has been updated to match the documentation and other drivers.",

Per our IRC discussion the idea seems to be.\n\nGiven A -\u003e B -\u003e C, if the merge of C and (master + A + B) fails, then C is reported back without waiting for A / B to start being processing.   But then C might be fine and the conflict be caused by B.  I guess that is the main difference, enabling this feature might confuse people about C having a merge conflict when it is really B.\n\nAs for Wikimedia, we do not use DependentPipeline (yet?) so I dont think we will get any impact there.",

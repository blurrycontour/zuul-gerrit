      "message": "I think we should keep the dict-or-list-of-dicts approach here.  We use that in a lot of places, and it\u0027s intentional so that the easy case of \"branches: master\" is nice and brief, and the complex case of a list of dicts is possible.  I think the main thing is that ability is an intentional general design choice for the configuration language, and not an accident that we need to deprecate and clean up.",

So:\n* ref-updated with no refs/ prefix means a change merged to a branch\n* ref-updated with refs/... means anything else (tag, refs/meta, etc)",

      "message": "to_list in driver.util is a copy of as_list in configloader.  So apparently at some point we decided that we\u0027d put some configloader helper methods in driver.util.  That doesn\u0027t sound like a bad idea, so I\u0027m trying to keep that going here, but without copying the code as happened with to_list.  But maybe we should unify as_list/to_list and clean that up.  Either way, there\u0027s a lot of stuff in configloader that isn\u0027t really meant to be used outside of it, and a few things that are, so dileneating that in some way seems good.\n\nMaybe let\u0027s keep this for now since it provides that signal, and we can look at other re-org options later.",

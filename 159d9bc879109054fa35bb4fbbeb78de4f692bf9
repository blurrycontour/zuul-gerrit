      "message": "It might be worth a note regarding the reason for the max_age/last_modified time: it\u0027s because it may take a while for an event processed by a connection (which will update/populate the cache) to eventually end up in a pipeline.  Realistically, that should only be a few minutes at most.\n\nWhich suggests an idea actually -- we could probably make this more accurate and reduce the necessary window by iterating over the pending events to collect cache keys as well.  That should narrow it down to only a few seconds.  That might be worth doing as a followup, but probably not necessary now?",

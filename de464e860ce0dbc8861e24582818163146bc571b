      "message": "As Jim suggested on the original change (https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/917039/comment/ece3b616_f2caa7a4/), I\u0027ve changed the color from white to a black. I decided to use black-300 as I find that black-500 is hard to differentiate from the dark background. For the hover color I used black-400. Let me know if that suits you.",

      "message": "This is better, thanks.  My main objective in suggesting 500 was that it should match the progress bar color since it\u0027s indicating something similar.  I do agree that 300 looks very dark, and it looks darker than the progress bar which is weird.  I measured the pixel values and they are in fact different, so I assume there may be some transparency setting having an influence or something.  I didn\u0027t track it down completely.\n\n300 is still a little light, I think, and that makes it slightly harder to read the squares as being \"incomplete\".  You might try 400 and see how that looks (I like it).  This is not a -1; I think we could go with either.",

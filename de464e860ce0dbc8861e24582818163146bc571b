I decided to use black-300 as I find that black-500 is hard to differentiate from the dark background. For the hover color I used black-400. Let me know if that suits you.",

      "message": "This is better, thanks.  My main objective in suggesting 500 was that it should match the progress bar color since it\u0027s indicating something similar.  I do agree that 300 looks very dark, and it looks darker than the progress bar which is weird.  I measured the pixel values and they are in fact different, so I assume there may be some transparency setting having an influence or something.  I didn\u0027t track it down completely.\n\n300 is still a little light, I think, and that makes it slightly harder to read the squares as being \"incomplete\".  You might try 400 and see how that looks (I like it).  This is not a -1; I think we could go with either.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve compared using 300/400 and 400/500 (normal/hover) and I get the feeling that this highly depends on the monitor that is used and also the brightness setting. On my external monitor 300/400 looks good, while 400/500 is quite hard to differentiate from the dark background. On my macbook screen 400/500 looks much better, while 300/400 is quite light in comparison -\u003e similar to what you wrote above.\n\nMy gut feeling says that 300/400 might be a better fit for most monitors as it provides a little more contrast to the background - with the drawback that it might look a little too light on some monitors. In the end I don\u0027t have a strict tendency to either one of those settings.",

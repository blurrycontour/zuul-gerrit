Reason for this is that this test triggers on one connection and tries to report on a different connection to the same gerrit.\n\nI don\u0027t know if this is a use case that should be supported but as the test exists it looks like a valid use case to me.\n\nIn order to skip voting to a wrong gerrit but still supporting the above use case you could compare the canonical hostnames instead:\n\n  if item.change.project.source.connection.canonical_hostname !\u003d self.connection.canonical_hostname:",

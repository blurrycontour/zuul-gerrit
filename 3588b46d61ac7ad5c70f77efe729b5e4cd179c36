      "message": "If we dropped the checkoutBranch() here would this test pass without modifying the assertions below? I\u0027m curious because I think updateRepo() should properly trigger the isUpdateNeeded() path and do the necessary updates as a result. But then checkoutBranch() may undo that state?\n\nUltimately we want to test what zuul is doing in job preparation which I suspect includes a checkoutBranch() so don\u0027t remove it here just to make the test pass :) Just curious if I am understanding this properly.",

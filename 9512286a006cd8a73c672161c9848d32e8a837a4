      "message": "Eek - they don\u0027t publish libraries to pypi? Ah - they do:\n\nhttps://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python\n\nsays pip install of both should work.\n\nThat said - that also says the library is alpha. I\u0027m guessing this patch is about being proactive ... perhaps we should make this optional? So - don\u0027t depend on the libraries, put the imports behind a try/except and make the tracing class you made properly no-op if the libraries aren\u0027t installed? That way we can potentially support people who are interested in trying this before upstream thinks it\u0027s totally ready without making all the zuul deployers be impacted if open-telemetry changes their api in a way that breaks things?",

      "message": "Yes, the whole opentelemetry project is still in alpha. There were quite some API changes since the last 0.3.0 release and I figured that it would make sense to already use the 0.4.0 API.\n\nThis is anyways still WIP and just for getting a feel for how that could be integrate into Zuul.\n\nWe might also be able to influence the implementation of the opentelemetry Python lib, in case we see a use-case that can\u0027t be covered with the current set of APIs. Their main use-case is tracing of web services and Zuul is a little different :)",

      "message": "I think this should be `stdout_late_lines.length \u003e 0` and on line 162 should be `stdout_early_lines.length \u003e 0`. The reason for this is the old code checked if there were any line present on line 162 which would be checking early_lines and then it checked if the content was longer than max_lines which would be checking late_lines.\n\nI think this would result in no summary if the content was super short. With this change we will always get a summary. I suspect the end result is relatively transparent to users, but want to make sure the change of behavior is intentional.",

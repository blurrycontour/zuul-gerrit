      "message": "I think this should be `stdout_late_lines.length \u003e 0` and on line 162 should be `stdout_early_lines.length \u003e 0`. The reason for this is the old code checked if there were any line present on line 162 which would be checking early_lines and then it checked if the content was longer than max_lines which would be checking late_lines.\n\nI think this would result in no summary if the content was super short. With this change we will always get a summary. I suspect the end result is relatively transparent to users, but want to make sure the change of behavior is intentional.",

      "message": "I got myself turned around comparing the new code to the old code. I should just be looking at the new code in isolation. In that case it is a lot clearer that this is equivalent to the old code. Basically if we have any lines at all then check if we have short content (only present if we have long content) and create a summary if so. Otherwise present the content.",

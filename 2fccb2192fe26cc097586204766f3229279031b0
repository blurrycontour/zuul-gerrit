      "message": "Please don\u0027t link to the developer docs from the user docs.  That\u0027s too much information to give users, and there\u0027s only one practical think for them to know: I\u0027m guessing you are interested in having the information about files left over.  I suggest copying/reworking a few sentences from the last paragraph(s) here.  Basically, tell them that Zuul uses tmp files with a certain name pattern and tries to clean them up but can\u0027t always and that\u0027s important for static nodes.\n\nActually, I think it may make more sense to move this section to the Nodepool section in doc/source/installation, make the change I suggested above, then link to there from here.",

If we just need this for overriding image attributes we should maybe call this \"image-overrides\" instead.",

      "message": "This is the same as the \"images\" attribute on the \"section\" object, that way a tenant can (if permitted) configure cloud/section-specific attributes of tenant-specific images.  In other words, a section might have image \"A\" and a provider might add image \"B\" to that, so that ultimately both A and B are available.\n\nI don\u0027t think I specified what should happen if we have \"A\" on both.  That should probably be an error?  Because we probably don\u0027t want a provider overriding something set on a section?\n\nWith that in mind, I think I\u0027d prefer to keep it as \"images\", but if we want to change it, I think it should be in both places.",

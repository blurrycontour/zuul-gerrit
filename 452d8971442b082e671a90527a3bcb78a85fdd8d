In d-g we first try refs/$BRANCH/ZSOMEREF if that fails we try refs/master/ZSOMEREF if that fails we checkout $BRANCH and if that fails we checkout master.\n\nThe only way for this to be stable/havana here is if zuul created a refs/stable/havana/ZSOMEREF that mapped to the stable/havana branch otherwise we should have checked out refs/master/ZSOMEREF and the ref here would be ZUUL_COMMIT because the second change is for project2.\n\nIs zuul creating refs/stable/havana/ZSOMEREF for us?",

You might want to rewrite this as:\n\n  log \u003d get_annotated_logger()\n  log.error(\u0027...\u0027)\n  if resp[1] not in (401, 409):\n      raise\n  elif approve \u003d\u003d \u0027approve\u0027 and resp[1] \u003d\u003d 409:\n      return\n\nThen the old behavior should be preserved for 401s.",

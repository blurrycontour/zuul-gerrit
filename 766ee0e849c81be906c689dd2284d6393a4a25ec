      "message": "I don\u0027t think it\u0027s relevant for this change, but this stands out since this isn\u0027t how I would expect this to be set up.\n\nNormally I\u0027d expect a single AWS connection with a single credential, and that credential has access to multiple regions.  Each region would be a section with the same connection.\n\nSince this is early work, I\u0027m a little worried about copy-pasta from this and people getting the idea that this is how you have multiple regions.  Is this necessary here, or can we put two sections on the same connection?",

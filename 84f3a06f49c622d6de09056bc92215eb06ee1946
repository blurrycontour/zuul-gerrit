      "message": "Possibly, but nothing is using these at the moment, so it\u0027s hard to tell what level of granularity would be useful.  I dug around a little bit and couldn\u0027t find any suggested uses for the field on the Gerrit side other than to test for its existence.  So my inclination was to keep it simple until we figured out it was a problem.\n\nWe could play it a little safer and add a robot_id option to the reporter that gets used here. That would let the admin set the robot_id for that pipeline and could also let them opt-in or -out of robot comments (though I don\u0027t see a disadvantage to using them).",

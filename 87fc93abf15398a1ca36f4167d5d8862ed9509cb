      "message": "1. I was just thinking if it is a good idea to put all the functionality into a single icon. Maybe it\u0027s better to just show the pipeline-specific icon add a second helper icon that provides the tooltip and the link to the zuul documentation.\n\nThis helper icon could be a greyed-out question-circle (https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons/question-circle?style\u003dregular) icon that is placed right behind the pipeline name and wrapped into a \u003csup\u003e tag (similar to the external link icon that is shown next to the \"View log\" link on the build result page).\n\nMaybe you could use the ExternalLink component https://opendev.org/zuul/zuul/src/branch/master/web/src/Misc.jsx#L24 (which should provide most of the style) and just allow to override the icon.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this adds to much noice to the status page, but I would give it a try.\n\n2. It might be a good idea to ensure that external links are always opened in a new tab.",

      "message": "I like the icon, but I think we should place it next to the pipeline name rather than between icon and pipeline name. Having an info icon next to another icon looks a little awkward in my opinion.\n\nAlthough the icon is used to show the type of pipeline, I still see the icon more like an extension to the pipeline name, so I think it\u0027s fine to add the icon to the pipeline name rather than the type icon. I also think that most users are used to the pipeline names already (which in most cases already reflect different types of pipelines), we just had no icon to visualize this pipeline type so far.",

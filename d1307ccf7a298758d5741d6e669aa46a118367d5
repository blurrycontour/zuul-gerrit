      "message": "I don\u0027t have the answer for this, but I think it would be good to update the help info here so that we better understand why triggers were included in the first place.\n\nThey don\u0027t seem to be used for anything (and don\u0027t end up in job inventories), but maybe there are plans to make use of this somehow? If there is no plan for using this info maybe help should include a deprecation notice and the flag will be removed. If there is a plan we can expand on that here and maybe not make it optional depending on the plan?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t know the exact history but I assume the idea was to mimic a real event, which always has a trigger by definition.  It turns out providing the project, pipeline \u0026 change info is enough for zuul to enqueue an event.\n\nShould we instead define a default \"manual\" or \"admin\" trigger that covers CLI/GUI events to be consistent with other triggers?",

      "message": "In the past there were already some discussions about making jobs aware of the trigger. All of them were rejected because zuul is meant to be a git driven system where it doesn\u0027t matter how a job was triggered. Judging from this design philosophy the trigger won\u0027t be used in future as well and if that changes the enqueue could hard code a \u0027manual\u0027 trigger inside zuul.\n\nNevertheless I think we should deprecate (and just ignore) the trigger argument.",

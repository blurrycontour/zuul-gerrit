    Users upgrading from version 4.10.0 or newer will need to run
    ``zuul delete-state`` to delete Zuul's ephemeral state from
    Zookeeper. The ephemeral state produced by 4.10.x and newer is
    not compatible with 4.11.0. This command should be run while all
    Zuul services are stopped to prevent writes to the Zookeeper
    database. More information on this command can be found in the
    documentation:
    https://zuul-ci.org/docs/zuul/reference/client.html#delete-state

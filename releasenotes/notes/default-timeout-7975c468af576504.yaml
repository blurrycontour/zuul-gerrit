    So far if the base job didn't specify a timeout no timeout was enforced
    regardless of :attr:`tenant.max-job-timeout`. This has been changed to
    default job timeouts to the the tenant's max job timeout if no timeout
    is set. This means that if no timeout is set anywhere those jobs default
    to the default max-job-timeout of 10800s. To retain the old behavior
    the max job timeout setting of the tenant can be set to -1.

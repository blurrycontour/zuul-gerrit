    The syntax of the tenant configuration file may be validated by
    running the zuul-scheduler program with the argument
    ``--validate-tenant-syntax``.  This will check for simple YAML
    format errors or errors such as listing a project twice, but will
    not perform any network operations to validate that projects
    actually exist or that the tenant configuration itself is valid.

    This may be used to ensure that an update to a tenant
    configuration file will not cause Zuul to be unable to load the
    tenant at all.  Since it should be able to load the tenant,
    further errors may be discovered through the web UI.

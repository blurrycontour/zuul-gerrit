    If you are using the :attr:`executor.winrm_cert_pem_file` setting
    to supply a certificate keypair for WinRM connections, you are no
    longer required to ensure that path appears in the
    :attr:`executor.untrusted_ro_paths` setting in order for the
    certificate to be made available to Ansible inside the restricted
    execution environment.  The contents of the file will automatially
    be supplied to Ansible via a tmpfs (so they should not be written
    to disk) in the same way that secrets are.

    If SSH keys or WinRM certificates are supplied by nodepool
    (currently only supported for static nodes) those will be used in
    preference to the keys and certificates supplied in the executor
    configuration.

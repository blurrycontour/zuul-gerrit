features:
  - |
    Added new fields to the document: start_datetime and end_datetime which
    represents conversion from timestamp to datetime in ISO format.
    This might be a better solution for those, who are using
    the Grafana Opensearch plugin to create dashboard with the build
    statistics.
issues:
  - |
    The start_time and end_time fields are a unix timestamp value, which is
    always integer. By changing that field type to integer, the Grafana
    OpenSearch plugin can properly parse the datetime.
fixes:
  - |
    The start_time and end_time are parsed as a string in OpenSearch, not
    as a number or date.

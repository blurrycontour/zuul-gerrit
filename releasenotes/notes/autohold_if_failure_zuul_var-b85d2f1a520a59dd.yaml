    Add a new Ansible variable to zuul_vars called "autohold_if_failure". This
    variable is set to true if the current job will trigger an autohold should
    it fail. This can be useful to prepare a debug environment, or take any other
    required steps, in a post playbook should this variable be true and zuul_success
    be set to false.

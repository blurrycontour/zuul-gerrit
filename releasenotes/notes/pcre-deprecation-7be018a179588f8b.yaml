deprecations:
  - |
    Regular expressions using PCRE syntax are deprecated.  Use RE2
    syntax instead.  Negative lookahead assertions may be replaced
    using the `negate` keyword.  See :ref:`regex` for more
    information.

    If Zuul detects a regular expression using PCRE syntax that is not
    supported by RE2, it will register a configuration syntax warning.
    These may be viewed on the configuration errors page in the web
    interface.

    A future version of Zuul will remove PCRE support completely and
    these warnings will become errors.

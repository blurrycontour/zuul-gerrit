    A change has been made to the branch selection routine for role
    repo checkouts in jobs triggered by tags.

    Previously, when checking out a role repo for a tag job, Zuul
    would check out the first match of the following:

      * The project override-checkout
      * The job override-checkout
      * If the role project is the playbook project, then the playbook project branch
      * The role project default branch

    It is now updated to the following:

      * The project override-checkout
      * The job override-checkout
      * The playbook project branch
      * The role project default branch

    This may be a change for certain jobs, but it is hoped that the
    new sequence is more intuitive.

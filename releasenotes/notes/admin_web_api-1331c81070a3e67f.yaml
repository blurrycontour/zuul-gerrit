    Allow users to perform tenant-scoped, privileged actions either through
    zuul-web's REST API or zuul's client, based on the JWT standard. The users
    need a valid bearer token to perform such actions; the scope is set via a
    token claim.
    Zuul supports token signing and validation using the HS256 or RS256 algorithms.
    External JWKS are also supported for token validation only.
    Current tenant-scoped actions are "autohold", "enqueue" and "dequeue".

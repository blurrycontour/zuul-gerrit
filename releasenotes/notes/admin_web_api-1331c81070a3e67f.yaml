    Add an endpoint protection mechanism to zuul-web's REST API, based on the JWT
    standard. A user can access protected endpoints with a valid bearer token.
    The actions associated to these endpoints are tenant-scoped via a token claim.
    Zuul supports token signatures using the HS256 or RS256 algorithms. External
    JWKS are also supported.
    Current protected endpoints are "autohold", "enqueue" and "dequeue".

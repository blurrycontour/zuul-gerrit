upgrade:
  - |
    Files (and irrelevant-files) matchers are now overridable.  Zuul
    now uses only branch matchers to collect job variants.  Once those
    variants are collected, they are combined, and the files and
    irrelevant-files attributes are inherited and overridden as any
    other job attribute.  The final values are used to determine
    whether the job should ultimately run.
  - Zuul now uses Ansible 2.5.

    An issue was discovered in Zuul 3.x before 3.1.0. If nodes become
    offline during the build, the no_log attribute of a task is
    ignored. If the unreachable error occurred in a task used with a
    loop variable (e.g., with_items), the contents of the loop items
    would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally
    leaking credentials or secrets. MITRE has assigned CVE-2018-12557
    to this vulnerability.

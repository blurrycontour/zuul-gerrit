    Files (and irrelevant-files) matchers are now overridable.  Zuul
    now uses only branch matchers to collect job variants.  Once those
    variants are collected, they are combined, and the files and
    irrelevant-files attributes are inherited and overridden as any
    other job attribute.  The final values are used to determine
    whether the job should ultimately run.

    Files and irrelevant-files now operate as a pair.  It is no longer
    permitted for both to appear on a single job variant.  When a
    files matcher appears later in the inheritance path, it overrides
    any earlier files and irrelevant-files matchers, and vice versa.

    Add a "zuul-web-client" CLI client, intended for end users with extended
    authorizations over a tenant (but not quite Zuul operators). This client
    consists of the REST API client that was taken out the original Zuul CLI
    client.
deprecations:
  - |
    The Zuul CLI client is limited to using the gearman client. To perform commands
    using the REST API, use the new zuul-web-client CLI client.

prelude: |
  This is expected to be the last 3.x release of Zuul (barring any
  unanticpated bugfix releases).

  The next release of Zuul, 4.0.0, will require the following
  deployment changes:

    * TLS ZooKeeper connections
    * A SQL database

  Both of these features are supported now, so it is important that
  you take this time to :ref:`switch your ZooKeeper connection to use
  TLS<zk-encrypted-connections>`, and :ref:`configure a SQL
  connection<sql-driver>`.  Doing so will make the upgrade to 4.0.0
  seamless.

  After the 4.0.0 release, it is anticipated that further upgrades to
  Zuul to work toward highly available and scale-out schedulers will
  be able to be in the course of normal releases.

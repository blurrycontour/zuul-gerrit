upgrade:
  - |
    Three sets of statsd starts are now reported for executors: zoned,
    unzoned, and all executors.  The existing statsd keys now
    correspond to all executors; new statsd keys are available for
    zoned and unzoned executors.  See :stat:`zuul.executors` for
    details.

    If zoned executors were used with prior releases of Zuul, the
    reported executor statistics would only represent a single,
    unspecified zone.  This has now been corrected.

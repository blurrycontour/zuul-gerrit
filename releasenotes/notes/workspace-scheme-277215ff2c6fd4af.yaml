    Jobs may now specify an alternate scheme to use when preparing
    repositories in the workspace.  The default remains the same
    golang-style, but an alternate scheme called `flat` is now
    available.  See :attr:`job.workspace-scheme` for more details.

    The internal git repo caches maintained by the mergers and
    executors now use a new naming scheme in order to avoid
    collisions.  This means that any existing git repos in the caches
    will be ignored.  To save space, you may want to delete the git
    repo caches after stopping executors and mergers and before
    starting them on the new version.

    Previously, Zuul would ignore unreachable host errors for some
    types of nodes (e.g., kubernetes pods or network appliances) if
    encountered during the setup phase of a job.  Zuul will now treat
    these as errors that should cause the job to be retried, however,
    a new job attribute, :attr:`job.ignore-setup-failure`, is
    available to retain the old behavior.

    Changes can now be dequeued via the Github checks API. If a github
    reporter is configured to use the checks API, all running checks will
    provide a custom "Abort" action.

    Please note that Zuul doesn't provide a dequeue reporting by now, and thus
    aborted check runs will get "lost in space". Meaning, the dequeue event
    won't update the check run and it will stay in state "in progress". You
    could configure your Github driver to trigger on PR comments and use those
    to trigger a recheck/regate/... to re-run the stuck check run.

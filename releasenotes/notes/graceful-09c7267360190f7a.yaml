features:
  - |
    The executor now honors the ``ZUUL_EXECUTOR_SIGTERM_METHOD``
    environment variable to determine whether ``SIGTERM`` should be
    equivalent to the ``stop`` command (the default) or the
    ``graceful`` command.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default behavior when an executor receives SIGTERM has been
    changed from immediately stopping jobs to gracefully waiting for
    them to finish.  See the new ``ZUUL_EXECUTOR_SIGTERM_METHOD``
    environment variable to specify the behavior.

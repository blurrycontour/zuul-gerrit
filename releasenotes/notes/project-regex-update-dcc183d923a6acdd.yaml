    Project regex processing has been updated to check canonical names first.
    This has been done so that common project name regexes like ^.*$ can be
    used even when a Zuul installation has colliding project names. The old
    behavior looked at project short names, and if there were multiple results
    raised an error. Now we check canonical names first and if any matches are
    made we return those matched and don't check short names. This means it
    is possible to have colliding short names and still use a regex like ^.*$.
    To try and be as backward compatible as possible we will check short names
    against the regex if no canonical names matched. It is still an error if
    a short name matches with multiple colliding repos. This is a small and
    subtle behavior change that may necessitate rewriting regexes if you don't
    want to match specific connection sources.

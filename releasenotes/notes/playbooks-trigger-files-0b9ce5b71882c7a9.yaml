    Jobs now have their dependent playbooks (directly and those
    inherited from the same project) implicitly added when using a
    ``file`` filter.  This means that modifying playbooks will cause
    jobs that use that playbook to automatically run without having to
    explicitly list the playbooks in the job's file filter.

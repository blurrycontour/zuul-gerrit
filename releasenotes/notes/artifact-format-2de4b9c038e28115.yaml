features:
  - Artifacts may now include a metadata field for storing arbitrary
    metadata about the artifacts in the SQL database.
deprecations:
  - Artifacts should now be supplied to zuul_return in dictionary form
    instead of a list.  See :ref:`return_artifacts`.

    This is to aid in multiple playbooks providing information back to
    Zuul without requiring coordination with each other.

    Support for the list format will be removed in a future version.

    GitHub pipeline triggers now support requiring or rejecting a
    status, label, or review in order to match.  This documents an
    existing hidden feature of "require-status" and expands on it.  It
    follows the pattern in the Gerrit driver with "require-approvals".

    This can be used to construct pipelines which trigger based on
    certain events but only if certain other conditions are met.  It
    is distinct from pipeline requirements in that it only affects
    items that are directly enqueued whereas pipeline requirements
    affect dependencies as well.

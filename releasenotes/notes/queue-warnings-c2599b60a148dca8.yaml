deprecations:

    Shared ``queues`` should be configured per project instead of per
    pipeline. Specifying :attr:`project.<pipeline>.queue` was already
    deprecated and will now produce a warning message when patchsets
    using the old syntax are uploaded.  The configuration errors area
    of the web UI will also display instances of the old syntax.

    Please use these tools to identify and update to the new syntax.
    A later release will remove support for the old syntax entirely.

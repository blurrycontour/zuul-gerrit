    Post-review jobs can now allow other projects to "borrow" their
    ssh keys.
    
    If a job is declared :attr:`job.final` and is used in a
    :attr:`pipeline.post-review` pipeline of a project listed in
    :attr:`job.allowed-projects`, then the :ref:`project SSH key
    <user_jobs_project_key>` of the project where the job was marked
    final is also made available to the job.

prelude: >
    Replace this text with content to appear at the top of the section for this
    release. All of the prelude content is merged together and then rendered
    separately from the items listed in other parts of the file, so the text
    needs to be worded so that both the prelude and the other items make sense
    when read independently. This may mean repeating some details. Not every
    release note requires a prelude. Usually only notes describing major
    features or adding release theme details should have a prelude.
features:
  - |
    List new features here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
issues:
  - |
    List known issues here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
upgrade:
  - |
    List upgrade notes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items in
    this section are combined when the release notes are rendered, so the text
    needs to be worded so that it does not depend on any information only
    available in another section, such as the prelude. This may mean repeating
    some details.
deprecations:
  - |
    The syntax of string substitution in pipeline reporter messages
    has changed.  Since queue items may now represent more than one
    change, the `{change}` substitution in messages is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future version.  To maintain backwards
    compatability, it currently refers to the arbitrary first change
    in the list of changes for a queue item.  Please upgrade your
    usage to use the new `{changes}` substitution which is a list.
  - |
    The syntax of string substitution in SMTP reporter messages
    has changed.  Since queue items may now represent more than one
    change, the `{change}` substitution in messages is deprecated and
    will be removed in a future version.  To maintain backwards
    compatability, it currently refers to the arbitrary first change
    in the list of changes for a queue item.  Please upgrade your
    usage to use the new `{changes}` substitution which is a list.
  - |
    The MQTT and Elasticsearch reporters now include a `changes` field
    which is a list of dictionaries representing the changes included
    in an item.  The correspending scalar fields describing what was
    previously the only change associated with an item remain for
    backwards compatability and refer to the arbitrary first change is
    the list of changes for a queue item.  These scalar values will be
    removed in a future version of Zuul.  Please upgrade yur usage to
    use the new `changes` entries.
  - |
    The `zuul.bundle_id` variable is deprecated and will be removed in
    a future version.  For backwards compatability, it currently
    duplicates the item uuid.

    some details.

    Add normal bug fixes here, or remove this section.  All of the list items

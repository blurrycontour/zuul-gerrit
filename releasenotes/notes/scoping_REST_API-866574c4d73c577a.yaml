features:
  - |
    REST API: Add non-scoped endpoints for autohold-info and autohold-delete.
    They are respectively "GET /api/autohold/{id}" and "DELETE /api/autohold/{id}".
  - |
    REST API: Add a tenant-scoped endpoint for connections. Connections are not scoped to
    a tenant, but this makes connections info available for whitelabeled API calls.
    "GET /api/connections" and "GET /api/tenant/{tenant}/connections" return the
    same content regardless of the tenant.
  - |
    REST API: authorizations: rename the endpoint to '/api/authorizations' and add a
    tenant-scoped endpoint at '/api/tenant/{tenant}/authorizations'. Calling
    the latter endpoint will return a list of admin tenants limited to the
    scoped tenant, if the user has admin privileges on it.

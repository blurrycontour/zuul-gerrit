    Changes with no files will no longer match the :attr:`job.files` matcher.

    Previously a change with no files (only a commit message) attached
    would nevertheless match all ``files`` matchers.  This was
    originally an attempt to avoid a situation where no jobs ran when
    merge commit was used for a Change.  More recently, Zuul is able
    to determine what files were changed by the child commits of merge
    commits and therefore files matchers work as expected.  Adjusting
    the behavior of the ``files`` matcher to not match empty commits
    allows for a more intuitive behavior, and an improved workflow for
    users creating changes in the Gerrit web UI.

    Added a feature to make it possible to retry more dynamically using
    `zuul_return`.

    For example it is now possible fail a job without causing a retry in pre-run
    by returning `retry: false`:
    ```
    - zuul_return:
        data:
          zuul:
            retry: false
    ```

    Or to cause a job to retry even when it failed in the `run` or `post-run`
    stages:
    ```
    - zuul_return:
        data:
          zuul:
            retry: true
    ```

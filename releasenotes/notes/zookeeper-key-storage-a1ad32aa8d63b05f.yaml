features:
  - |
    Project secrets keys and SSH keys are now stored in Zookeeper. All private
    data will be encrypted at rest, which requires a new mandatory setting
    :attr:`scheduler.key_store_password` in ``zuul.conf``.
upgrade:
  - |
    As project secrets keys and SSH keys are stored encrypted in Zookeeper the
    new :attr:`scheduler.key_store_password` option in ``zuul.conf`` is
    required. Please add it to your configuration.
  - |
    Zuul will store secrets keys and SSH keys from now on in Zookeeper and no
    longer on disk. Existing keys on the filesystem will be imported into
    Zookeeper.
deprecations:
  - |
    Zuul will no longer store secrets keys and SSH keys on disk. The import of
    existing keys from the filesystem will be removed in the future.

    Zuul now supports multiple ansible versions in parallel. The ansible version
    to use can now be specified by :attr:`job.ansible-version`.
upgrade:
  - |
    In order to support several ansible versions in parallel zuul now handles
    them itself in virtual environments. By default zuul installs the needed
    ansible versions on startup so there is no further user action required.
    However it is recommended to pre-install the ansible environments during
    installation by invoking ``zuul-manage-ansible``.

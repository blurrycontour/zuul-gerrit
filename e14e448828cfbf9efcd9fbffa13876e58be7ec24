I still would love to have access to all of them as a pipeline auther, if possible, though.",

      "message": "This is just a tiny bit ambiguous, relying on the distinction between \"None\" and \"NONE\" to suggest that Zuul does not supply a default.  I think it would be best to omit the \":default:\" tag here; the text below indicates that we delegate the default handling to Gerrit (which I think is appropriate; I don\u0027t think we should say \"ALL\" here).\n\n(Usually we try to keep these values to literal yaml values; sometimes we put in explanatory texts.  If you really want something here, we could have it say \":default: The Gerrit default behavior\".  But I think it\u0027s more clear to omit.)",

      "message": "0: Is it okay to modify the dict in place here?  I\u0027m sure it\u0027s fine for everything related to the callback, but is there any chance this is the same dict that might ultimately be used by something else, like register?\n\nWould it be safer to return a copy here and pass that copy to the superclass on_failed and on_ok methods?",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure it would be any different - what those methods take is a result instance, of which the dict here is the _result member. So if we did a copy, we\u0027d still have to assign it to result._result to pass it down.\n\nThat said - in the next patch we essentially completely replace the on_success method. We could do the same for the on_failure method if it\u0027s a problem.",

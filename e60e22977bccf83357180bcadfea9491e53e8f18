If we decide that we don\u0027t need one, we can simply drop this change.\n\nThe design is based on the PF4 footer (which apparently has the same problem when there isn\u0027t enough content on the page). I tried to fix this but didn\u0027t find a working solution without breaking the page layout.\n\nUsing the components page for this use case works for me.",

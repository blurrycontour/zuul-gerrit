      "message": "I think you are right. When we deserialize the bundle we are already in the process of resolving the objects at the `ChangeQueue` level.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s enough to just set the bundle after we\u0027ve created the `QueueItem` (`item._set(bundle\u003dbundle)`) but I\u0027m wondering if there could be other issues with e.g. unresolved items ahead/behind?",

      "message": "OK, if I\u0027m understanding the concern, a base job in one repo might use, say \n\n pre-run: playbooks/pre.yaml\n\nand then a different project might have a file playbooks/pre.yaml, be inherited to the original-base job, not actually be using playbooks/pre.yaml in the job, but the job may now trigger if playbooks/pre.yaml in this repo is updated?\n\nI think we can work-around this by just checking the playbook files we\u0027re adding here are coming from the same canonical project name.",

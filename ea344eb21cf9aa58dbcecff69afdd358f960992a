      "message": "This seems like we\u0027re only including the first project/branch combination, whereas if this event was merged with another, it could have more than one.  Shouldn\u0027t we serialize it the same way?\n\nISTR you mentioned elsewhere that by putting these into ZK we may lose our ability to de-duplicate them; maybe that\u0027s the reasoning here.  But if so, I think we should either leave a code comment here explaining the difference until that\u0027s merged, or implement the current data structure until we need to change it (so that we\u0027re reviewing the entirety of that change at once).  Otherwise, we increase the risk of introducing an error if something changes between now and then.",

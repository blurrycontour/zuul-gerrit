      "message": "Having globally injected yaml-tag handlers to handle specific fields feels like the wrong level of abstraction. I can see the use case of being able to write encrypted strings for any field in the whole configuration, but `!override` or `!inherit` is very specific.\n\nAnother downside with yaml-tags is that they cannot be expressed in Json. Json is a subset of Yaml, so a generator can output Json configurations for Zuul to pick up, unless you yaml-tags are part of the configuration.\n\nWhat about allowing tags to be specified as either strings or objects?\n\n```\n- job:\n    tags:\n      - foo\n      - { label: \"bar\", override: true }\n      - { label: \"baz\", inherit: true }\n```",

/* Patternfly 4 migration:
 * These are extracts from the original Patternfly 3 CSS rules which are
 * overwritten by some Patternfly 4 CSS wildcard expression. These expressions
 * mostly affect the padding and margin of various HTML tags being set to 0.
 *
 * Those wildcard rules can be found in
 * node_modules/@patternfly/react-core/dist/styles/base.css by searching for
 * "[class*="pf-c-"]" (without quotes).
 *
 * To "restore" those original values, we can copy the overwritten parts from
 * the original CSS rules and paste them here.
 *
 * This file should be save to delete after the transition is finished.

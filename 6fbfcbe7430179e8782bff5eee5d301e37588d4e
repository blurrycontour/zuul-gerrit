      "message": "So, I am not sure if we want to include the home directory by default.  That would mean we\u0027d have to expose our complete .ssh folder on executors today.  I could be possible we have SSH keys for other trusted servers there.\n\nHowever, we still need to bind mount of ssh_private_key file for zuul user.  Since it is a config settings in zuul.conf, it many also not exists in home .ssh directory.",

      "message": "clarkb brought up an interested suggestion. Maybe we use ssh-agent to handle our SSH keys within bubblewrap.  I\u0027m going to do some testing around SSH_AUTH_SOCK and see if that will work.\n\nA quick test would look like the following:\n\n  --bind $SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SSH_AUTH_SOCK \\\n  --setenv SSH_AUTH_SOCK $SSH_AUTH_SOCK \\\n\nWhich _should_ remove the need to mount home and our SSH keys in bubblewrap",

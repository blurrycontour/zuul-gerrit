      "message": "cache_keys is a set of unquoted keys due to line 94. I think that we put unquoted keys in self._change_cache because _cacheItemWatcher gets the key from _keyFromPath which calls unquote.\n\nHowever here we call the keys we iterate over quoted_key. Is this actually a quoted key? If so I think we have a data type mismatch somewhere? Though I\u0027m having a hard time finding exactly where and maybe this var should just be called key or unquoted_key to reduce confusion.",

I modified test_cache_sync so that the key has a space (\"foo foo\" instead of \"foo\"), and I can see that we\u0027re setting a data watch on a node that will never exist.  Clark is right, these are unquoted keys.\n\nNow, having done that, the test still doesn\u0027t fail, and I think that\u0027s because it\u0027s flawed.

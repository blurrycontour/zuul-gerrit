      "message": "Okay, sorry I\u0027ve failed to convey the concern twice now.  Here\u0027s what we need to do:\n\nRemove lines 54 through 67 and replace them with this pseudocode:\n\nif (cert or key) and not cacert:\n  raise Exception\nif cacert:\n  tls_set()\n\nThis isn\u0027t about making sure we pass the right arguments to tls_set.  The problem is the conditional on line 54.  It means that someone could write a config file that looks like:\n\n[connection mqtt]\ncertfile\u003dfoo.pem\nkeyfile\u003dkey.pem\n\nAnd they would think that means they\u0027re getting a TLS connection, but they aren\u0027t and they would never know.  We need to prevent that from happening.",

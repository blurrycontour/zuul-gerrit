      "message": "Here and above on line ~517 we seem to skip things if the inverse of this flag is set. I find that reads confusingly. It seems to be saying \"if the skip flag is set then don\u0027t skip the check below\" and \"if the skip flag is not set then skip the check\".",

      "message": "I grant it\u0027s not the most straightforward thing, but we often have \"skip...\" flags for things that are very unusual.  I guess this is sort of double-backwards in that the presence check we\u0027re skipping is the line right before (ie, in this case, the presence check is line 575 and the skip eval is line 576.  Still, I think it follows patterns we have elsewhere, and I think it makes the most sense for the function signature.",

      "message": "There are two \"skips\" happening here which is what I got confused over. The first is \"skip the check in this conditional (isChangeAlreadyInQueue() and isChangeAlreadyInPipeline()). The second is \"short circuit this entire function, return early, and skip subsequent checks\".\n\nThe new parameter refers to the first skip and I was looking at it from the perspective of the second during my first review comment. I think this is probably fine as is. The code isn\u0027t difficult to trace through if necessary.",

      "message": "filter/map have been available in Python since 1.5.2, at least.  I remember when list comprehensions were touted as far superior for readability.  Here\u0027s a blast from the past: \n\n  https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/ch01s11.html\n\nAnyway, it probably suffices to say I\u0027m aware of filter and this was a deliberate choice.  We can all handle reading both forms, and we probably don\u0027t need to nitpick it?",

But I can understand if others prefer comprehensions because they are more explicitly written out.\n\nI only mentioned it here because I wasn\u0027t sure of the performance equivalence (they are functionally equivalent).

      "message": "Then pass last_change_queues as the argument the combineChangeQueues. WIthout there is no shared state across iterations of this loop. I have a hunch the test is passing because the loop is running at least twice (first iteration sets last_change_queues and second iteration finds last_change_queues has the same length as new_change_queues), and these two iterations are sufficient to make the test case pass. But it may not always be sufficient so we need to fix this in the general case.",

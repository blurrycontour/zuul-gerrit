Then if we have any errors the event will hang around allowing us to try removal again later?\n\nAlso if you get NoNodeError when deleting the side_channel_path I think you want to continue to try and delete the event itself. I believe this is why you have the current order, but I don\u0027t think the current order would handle other errors (like connection errors?) properly.",

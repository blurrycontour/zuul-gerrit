To me it looks like you also expect this but I consider this a non-widespread knowledge detail about ansible which many CI users of the non-devops domain may not have.\n\nSo I would like to have one of the following:\n\n- Document this and/or move the roles above tasks to match the visual and execution flow.\n\n- Convert the task into a role which makes the execution order precice to the reader.\n\nI\u0027m fine with either way.",

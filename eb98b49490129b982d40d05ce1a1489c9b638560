Instead I have used the CI built site preview to poke around the new dashboard against OpenDev\u0027s Zuul. Overall things seem to work for me and I haven\u0027t found any deal breaker behaviors.\n\nI did have some feedback which I\u0027ve put into https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/new-zuul-dashboard-feedback as I don\u0027t think any of it needs to hold up proceeding with this stack, but may make for useful improvements in the future.",

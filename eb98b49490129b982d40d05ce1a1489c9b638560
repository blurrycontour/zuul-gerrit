Instead I have used the CI built site preview to poke around the new dashboard against OpenDev\u0027s Zuul. Overall things seem to work for me and I haven\u0027t found any deal breaker behaviors.\n\nI did have some feedback which I\u0027ve put into https://etherpad.opendev.org/p/new-zuul-dashboard-feedback as I don\u0027t think any of it needs to hold up proceeding with this stack, but may make for useful improvements in the future.",

The JavaScript code looks great to me too. Though I think your feedback also makes sense, and I would be happy to hold on until it is addressed.",

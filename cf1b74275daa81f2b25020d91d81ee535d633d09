      "message": "The old code had the str conversions too but I don\u0027t think they are necessary because the variables are already of type str (tested locally with python3). This shouldn\u0027t affect constant time comparison though because converting str to str should be constant time and not vary in the length of the strings.\n\nThat said it would be kind of nice to remove the redundant function calls.",

      "message": "Reading more the webob request headers may not be str, looks like that is based on encoding headers sent in the request? but in that case you\u0027d get b\u0027foo\u0027 and str(b\u0027foo\u0027) \u003d\u003d \"b\u0027foo\u0027\" so the comparison may not work out exactly there either.\n\nThis might need more investigating into webob behavior.",

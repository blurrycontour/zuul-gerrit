      "message": "Yes.  That would fix python2.7 for every derived environment - I was leaving a glimmer of hope for the future where more of the environments worked with py3.  Note for example the \"docs\" environment below that *does* work with python3.\n\nI\u0027m not fussed however - if you think it looks better to fix it \"globally\" in [testenv] and don\u0027t care about the version used for [testenv:docs], then I\u0027m happy to adjust it as you suggest.",

      "message": "Right. This is necessary to break up the app into components so we don\u0027t have to consume it all if we don\u0027t want to.\n\nWe could have a method that takes parameters to decide what is loaded, although I\u0027d put that into a different js file as the current one is now more or less a jquery plugin.\n\nIn my opinion though it\u0027s pretty normal to have the app bootstrapping inline in this. It looks like a lot of js but if you remove the comments and extra URL handling it\u0027s not much.",

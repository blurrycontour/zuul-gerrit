      "message": "Is it possible we could have two different job_combine lists for a job that should be deduplicated down to a single job. For example `[[Aa, Ab], [Ac, Ad]]` should be deduped to just `Aa` but instead we may get `[Aa, Ac]`?\n\nI think this is not the case as long as the for loop on 3748 iterates through all (remaining) jobs each time we loop through on the while loop. But wanted to make sure that is the case.",

      "message": "Yes, your explanation is correct.\n\nAs a point of interest, there is a possibility to end up with [Aa, Ac] but only if Aa and Ac are not equal (in which case they should really be Aa and Ba).  But I wanted to point out that, while unlikely in practice, it is possible/supported to have 4 instances of job foo deduplicate down to 2 instances, because 2 of the jobs are equivalent, and the other set of 2 jobs are equivalent.",

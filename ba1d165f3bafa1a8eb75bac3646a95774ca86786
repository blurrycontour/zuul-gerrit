      "message": "In scheduler.py we use this method a couple of times for getting the layout uuid from the LayoutState:\n\n  layout_state \u003d self.tenant_layout_state.get(tenant_name)\n  layout_uuid \u003d layout_state and layout_state.uuid\n\nThis means we can pass in a layout_state of False. In that case I think we should generate a new uuid? Otherwise we\u0027ll end up with False serialized uuids?\n\nBut also we want to generate a new uuid anytime we generate a brand new layout state in zookeeper and this would be the way to do that?",

      "message": "I\u0027ve created the ZooKeeper client directly in the test case and shared it with the different components (executor, merger). This is necessary to make later patches (which actually use the zk_client) work as otherwise the cleanup might be called before the components stop resulting in \"Missing Kazoo client\" exceptions. I think, we also decided to share the client in the tests last week.",

      "message": "Makes sense; let\u0027s keep this in mind when we refactor the connection class.  I think if we can find a way to have separate connections that would make more realistic tests.  There are only about 4 tests that use a separate merger, so efficiency isn\u0027t a big concern.",

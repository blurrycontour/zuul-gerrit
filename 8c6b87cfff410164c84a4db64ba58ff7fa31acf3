So I\u0027d go one step further -- we should pop the entire zuul entry from the dict before we report it.  That\u0027s what I just did for the mqtt reporter, and I think this should behave the same way.\n\u003e \n\u003e I\u0027d just do that and add a deprecation release note to let people know.  No one should be relying on that.\n\nI\u0027ve updated the review accordingly to your comment üëç\nThe main issue we have can be dealt by removing `zuul` data from the indexed document",

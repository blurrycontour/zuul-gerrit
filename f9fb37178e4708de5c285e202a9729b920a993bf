Before it wasn\u0027t using any version, it was pointing to a resource that didn\u0027t exist. I didn\u0027t want to put the burdon of maintenance here to keep jquery up to date here as well so I figured a sensible default is to use it from the CDN. Then any local configuration can do as they please.",

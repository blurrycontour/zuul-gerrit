We appear to construct data like:\n\n  { \u0027path\u0027: {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027foo\u0027, \u0027checkout\u0027: \u0027bar\u0027, \u0027commit\u0027: \u0027123467\u0027} }\n\nbut the statement above doesn\u0027t really convey that. Maybe update this line to say:\n\n  The key is the path and each value is another dict with the following key value pairs.",

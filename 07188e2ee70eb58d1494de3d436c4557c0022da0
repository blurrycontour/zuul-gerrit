That then determines if we call prepareItem() which will call getLayout and generate a layout if necessary.\n\nIs this condition correct?",

      "message": "Yes, it\u0027s an ususual phrasing on the comment.  I believe the comment was only intended to explain the second part of the boolean clause: \"or has_job_graph\".  In other words:\n\nIf the item is active, we should totally prepare it.\nIf the item is not active, but does have a job graph, that means it was probably active at some point in the past, so we should prepare it because we don\u0027t want old data from before the re-enqueue sticking around.",

You make a good point that it seems like this sentence has redundant words, however, I don\u0027t like the way it reads without them, or some kind of equivalent.\n\nI agree that telling people it\u0027s a computer program is weak, and yet, I think we should tell them what it is, not merely what it does.  So the best solution might be to continue to tell them what it is, but find something more interesting to say about what it is.\n\nI\u0027d like to leave this as-is for now and refine this very important bit in its own change later.",

Then we can follow with a note that these names are arbitrary and can be redefined - but honestly I think I\u0027d like to discourage people from defining pipelines named check, gate and post with arbitrarily different behaviors.\n\nIt\u0027s super powerful that they are only config - but I worry that that\u0027s too much power out of the gate.",

      "message": "This makes me want to dredge up a massively old bikeshed. Namely - is there actual value in keeping zuul.conf as INI format rather than making it yaml too? Since we have things like multiple gerrit connections, maybe we\u0027ve kept it too long just because the migration pain wasn\u0027t worth it?",

And I don\u0027t think anything bad can come of using slightly out of date data here -- at least, a different thread failing to update the cache in a timely manner is no worse than the github data actually being different, which is something we\u0027re already subject to (for example, if we somehow notice a new pr with the same sha before we notice that the first was closed -- that could cause us to ignore the event, but is unlikely to happen).",

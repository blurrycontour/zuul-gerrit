      "message": "This isn\u0027t really a callback though, right?  It\u0027s a method that rate limits logging.  I spent a while trying to figure that out; I think it\u0027s misleading enough we should call it something like \"logConnectionRetryEvent\".  Sorry to niggle on a method name, but callbacks are an important concept in zk.\n\nOtherwise I think the change is fine.",

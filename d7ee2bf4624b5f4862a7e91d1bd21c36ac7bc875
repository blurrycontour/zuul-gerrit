I suppose that presents the problem of needing to understand the tree relationship between changes within a project branch? Might also be inaccurate if there are intermediate merge commits?\n\nMostly looking at _waitForRefSha() and it seems we could wait an insufficient amount of time if one but not all of the changes in the bundle merge.",

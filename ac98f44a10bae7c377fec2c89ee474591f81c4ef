      "message": "I think that the user information, particularly the private key, shouldn\u0027t be in the layout.yaml, but rather in the config.  I was going to suggest that instead of this, you could define gerrit \"users\" in the config file, but I think your suggestion in https://review.openstack.org/#/c/112410/ of actually defining the trigger itself in terms of driver+url+user+etc in the config file and referring to it by name here is even better.  So I\u0027m imagining something vaguely like:\n\n  [connector \"openstack-gerrit\"]\n  driver\u003dgerrit\n  server\u003d..\n  user\u003d...\n  sshkey\u003d...\n\n(Maybe we call the union of sources/triggers/reporters \u0027connectors\u0027?)\n\nand then:\n\n  source:\n    openstack-gerrit\n  trigger:\n    openstack-gerrit:\n      - event: patchset-created\n  success:\n    openstack-gerrit:\n      verified: 1",

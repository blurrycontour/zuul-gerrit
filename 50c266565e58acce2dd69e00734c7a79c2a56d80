      "message": "Why is this pipeline here?  (And gate too?)\n\nThey really clutter up the test output.  I find it helpful to read the logs from test runs to understand what zuul is doing and make sure that it\u0027s behaving as expected (and not doing something that we won\u0027t catch just from test assertions).  But all the extra queue messages from these pipelines make it pretty hard to read.",

      "message": "Nit: maybe consider a 2 line version of this?  Any of the ways to write this in 2 lines would more closely match the predominant style and conserve vertical space (if we did the whole method like this, it would grow from 15 to 26 lines).",

      "message": "To be honest I find this formatting much more readable than the 2 line version as you can better differentiate between the if condition and the body of the statement. In the 2 line version you always have to search for the end of the if condition \"):\" to see where the body line starts. I\u0027d also find this method much more readable if it would take 26 instead of 15 lines and I don\u0027t see the point in saving lines of code in such cases.",

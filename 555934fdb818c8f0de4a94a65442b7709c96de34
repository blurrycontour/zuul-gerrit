Horizontal scrolling of log lines is critical for my use of the system, which is why I made sure that this log view was horizontally scrollable when I wrote it.  I understand others have different preferences, which is why Sorin is working on the ability to toggle, which I expect us to add after this PF4 refactor is done.  But let\u0027s keep the current behavior, and then add optional wrapping behavior later with the toggle.",

      "message": "Yep. After a pipeline is disabled there could still be successful runs. The count at this point doesn\u0027t matter but we still want the correct SUCCESS/FAILURE message to go back to whatever reporter is configured when disabled.\n\nWe could put the below IF that actually turns on _disabled \u003d True next to the above _consecutive_failures +\u003d 1 but it wouldn\u0027t gain much and would still be tested every time there is a failure. (It\u0027ll bail pretty early due to the check that it\u0027s not already disabled).",

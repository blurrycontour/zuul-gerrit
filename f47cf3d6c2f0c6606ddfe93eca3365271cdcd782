      "message": "Thinking out loud here would it be safer to serialize and deserialize these queues with an explicit association rather than inferring it from a project + branch name?\n\nI wonder what would happen if you reconfigure to move a project from one queue to another and that doesn\u0027t get serialized properly due to an outage. I guess the second scheduler would read the old data and reconcile it against the new config and then write that out to zookeeper? So for a (short) period of time you may run the old config for queues?",

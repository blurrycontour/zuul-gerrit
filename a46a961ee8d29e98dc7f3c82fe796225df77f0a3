      "message": "Not a minus one: When we started the API, we explicitly decided not to make any compatability guarantees.  It would be okay to go ahead and change both the front and backend right now.  I would be okay with that if you wanted to update the change for it.  However, that would make it difficult to test this change with the live dashboard jobs, so if you want to keep this as written, that\u0027s okay with me too.  But I think we should remove the compatability immediately afterwords.\n\nIf folks thing we now want to start maintaining multiple versions of the API indefinitely, then I think that needs a mailing list discussion.  However, I would object to that.  That seems an easy way to accumulate technical debt indefinitely and I think we have better things to do with our limited time.",

      "message": "If we don\u0027t make any compatibility guarantees, I\u0027m fine to ditch this header field. I just came up with this in the first place because I thought you wanted to have the API compatible :D\n\nRegarding the live dashboard test: This is - even if I keep it like this - only testable once the change is deployed to the zuul instances that serve as API for the live dashboard, or? Thus, even if we keep it like that, the follow-up change for the frontend https://review.opendev.org/#/c/746463/ cannot immediately be tested in the live dashboard.\n\nSo I\u0027m fine with removing this part and I would rather not start a discussion about compatibility or not if you don\u0027t have a guarantee for it ;-)",

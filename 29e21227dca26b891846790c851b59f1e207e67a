      "message": "The insertion of the new text doesn\u0027t quite fit with the old, and we also need to mention that the implicit value *does* assume the playbooks/ directory.  Also, the \u0027.::\u0027 at the end will render as \u0027.:\u0027 which is strange.  How about this:\n\nThe name of the main playbook for this job.  This parameter is\nnot normally necessary, as it defaults to a playbook with the\nsame name as the job inside of the `playbooks/` directory (e.g.,\nthe `foo` job would default to `playbooks/foo`.  However, if a\nplaybook with a different name is needed, it can be specified\nhere.  The file extension is not required, but the full path\nwithin the repo is.  When a child inherits from a parent, a\nplaybook with the name of the child job is implicitly searched\nfirst, before falling back on the playbook used by the parent\njob (unless the child job specifies a ``run`` attribute, in which\ncase that value is used).

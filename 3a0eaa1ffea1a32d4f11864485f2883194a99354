I\u0027m just thinking if it would make sense to also use \"authorization_rules\" within the Python code rather than \"authz_rules\". I often find the written-out form (is it called like that?) more speakable than the abbreviation. This is only my opinion, so no blocker.",

      "message": "Just for my understanding on the difference between admin-rule and authorization-rule:\nThe admin-rule in the tenant configuration was renamed to authorization-rule because it is used to validate that a user is authorized depending on whatever criteria are specified by this rule. The tenant attribute on the other hand is still called admin-rule because it really tells that the linked authorization-rule will enable admin access to the tenant. We did that split to allow further levels of authorization on for a tenant (let\u0027s call it something like a \"moderator\" or some kind of \"privileged user\" for a tenant). Did I understand that correctly?",

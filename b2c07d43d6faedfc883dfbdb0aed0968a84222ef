Maybe better to say that `path + \"/secrets\"` could not be found / does not exist.\n\nLooking at the code I think it is theoretically possible for a project to have an ssh key but not a secrets key. However, that would only be possible in the case of a manually curated zk database? Otherwise zuul should ensure both get created in zk.",

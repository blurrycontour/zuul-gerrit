However, the exception being handled is (somewhat) expected.  Perhaps a better place would be right after the query method.  You could test for whether no data were returned when querying a change we know should exist, and just retry that 5 times (after maybe a short sleep?).  I\u0027m also not sure I like the fact that this puts events back out of order.",

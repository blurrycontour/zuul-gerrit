We have tests of the desired behavior, and there is no upgrade path from where this test starts and this change, so this test is counter-productive now.\n\n(Keep in mind that essentially all model upgrades before this point are no longer necessary because we are clearing the state for this upgrade; a later change removes them all.)",

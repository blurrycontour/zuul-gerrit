      "message": "The reason we have \"...and no event\" errors is because at one point, if we didn\u0027t have a change in the cache, then we would populate the change entry from the events.  It looks like that is no longer teh case, so that means this change is safe (it would not have been before -- we would have been constructing changes from the wrong event).  Moreover, I thin kwe can remove all of the \"...and no event\" checks and errors.  I think we should do that now since we have verified they are no longer necessary.",

      "message": "This method only exists to log the job data at this point. Would it be better to simply pass it? Or remove it altogether?\n\nAs an alternative should we keep the method largely as is? its purpose is to return info back to gearman about build status. We can clean this up when gearman goes away? I think for now it would only make sense for the merge jobs?",

And of course, if there is starvation in that case, another scheduler can be added.\n\nAlso, I think since we get the event list at the start of the iterator, we\u0027ll eventually move on to other pipelines and tenants, so a busy tenant could cause other tenants to \u0027pause\u0027 but not completely starve them.",

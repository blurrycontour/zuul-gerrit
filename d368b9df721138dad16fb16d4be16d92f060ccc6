Do you know how it\u0027s possible to get a Change object without a cache_stat?  I think that would mean that the driver returned a change from getChangeByURL without putting it into the ZK change cache, and I don\u0027t think we expect that to ever happen.\n\nLast time this happened I wasn\u0027t able to track down how we can end up in that situation, but I found another occurrence today. There I was able to see that there was a concurrent update of a dependency around the same time. I updated the change with what I think should fix this edge case.\n\nI think I still want to add some tests though.",

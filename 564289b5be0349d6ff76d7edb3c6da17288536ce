The reason for this is we prepare the job vars before the job starts but we evaluate autoholds when the job completes. This means there is a period of time where a job can start and set autohold_if_failure to False then an autohold is added, then the job fails and is held. I don\u0027t think there is a good solution to this maybe the best thing is simply to document that possibility here?",

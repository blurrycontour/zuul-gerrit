      "message": "I suspect that the .append() and .add() here may need updated information in the case of a cherry pick merge too? The reason is we know that the dep_ps value is out of date here after a cherry pick which is why the old code isn\u0027t working right? In that case we want refer to the actual merged dep_ps rather than the old stale one in our dep_key.\n\nPretty sure its stale because the old dep_ps is part of dep_key constructed on line 880.",

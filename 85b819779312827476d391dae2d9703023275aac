      "message": "-1: We need the reconfiguration time as an actual timestamp somewhere.  You can make it a mouseover or otherwise make it inconspicuous if you want to keep both, but if we only have one, it should be absolute.\n\nThe reason to have it in absolute time is in order to determine whether some item currently in a pipeline was started with the current configuration or an older one.  To do that, you need the exact reconfiguration time, as well as when the item configuration was frozen (which we don\u0027t have, but we do have the build start time which is close enough).\n\nI am curious what the use case for a relative timestamp is.  I can\u0027t think of one other than a general assurance that something happened either recently or not.  That would also be served by an absolute timestamp.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve added the absolute timestamp in a tooltip. That one uses the same format as on the old status page. Let me know if that works for you - if not, we could also switch directly to the absolute timestamp.\n\nI find that most websites nowadays use relative timestamps, so I wanted to give it a try. I find them helpful in some cases (e.g. when you don\u0027t have to check the current day/date and \"compare\" it against the timestamp. So you just know it was x minutes or x hours back). But I also get the point that they can be very inaccurate when it comes to something like \"a few minutes back\" or \"last month\".",

      "message": "It\u0027s certainly worth being aware of what other websites are doing and that can inform our work.  But also, most websites are not doing what we are doing; and in the case of timestamps, the use case might be simply \"this review of the best frying pan was from 2 years ago so I should look for a newer one\".  I\u0027m never going to buy that as a use case for Zuul.\n\nSo I\u0027m really looking for someone to say \"I know all the changes that merge to the base-jobs repo and so I just need to know if the one change that merged today has taken effect or not, and a relative timestamp that says \u00275 minutes ago\u0027 versus \u0027yesterday\u0027 is helpful to me so I don\u0027t have to read so many numbers\".  No one has said that, but I can imagine it, which is why, if that\u0027s where you\u0027re coming from, I think it\u0027s okay to add.\n\nWe also know that (because I said it myself) we have the use case of \"I don\u0027t know all the changes that merge, but I do know that the one I care about merged at 17:14 UTC so I need to know if the reconfiguration time is 17:14 or later.\"\n\nAnyway, tooltip looks good, thanks.",

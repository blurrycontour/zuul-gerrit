      "message": "I agree we should check that.  I added a new test for that in https://review.opendev.org/c/zuul/zuul/+/925299\n\nUnfortunately, that test passes, so we\u0027re still missing a factor for whatever causes zuul-web to not start.\n\nRegardless, I think this change is good: it merely acknowledges that the traceback in the test logs (the missing min_ready entry due to the new branch) is expected.  I believe we want to keep that traceback in order to help debug issues related to the branch cache.",

      "message": "That\u0027s currently the only place ( that I\u0027m aware of) where the checks API is kind of mixed with the status API. I though about adding a new \"check\" requirement, but the GithubCommonFilter.matchesStatuses() method which evaluates this status is checked in various places. So, adding an equivalent for the checks API might make everything much more complex. If you OK with the rest, we could find a solution for that in a follow-up change.",

This test shows at least that the reporter and/or zuul doesn\u0027t crash on this :-)",

      "message": "Current deployments probably need the documented additional access rights to access checks. So we need to prepare ourselves that this might fail with 401 and handle this gracefully. This is needed for a proper upgrade path as it\u0027s necessary to not just update the permissions of the app but the users of the app must acknowledge the new permissions.",

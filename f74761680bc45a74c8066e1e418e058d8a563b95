      "message": "It\u0027s actually not possible to provide \u0027name\u0027 as a parameter to the template because the keyword \u0027name\u0027 is used to identify the template.  Consider an example:\n\n  projects:\n    - name: openstack/foo\n      template:\n        - name: template_one\n          foo: bar\n          name: baz\n\nNote that is not likely to work because name is defined twice, though unfortunately it is a limitation of the yaml parser that we can not validate that (last one wins, so it\u0027s actually going to override template_one with baz, and try to do a template lookup for the baz template).\n\nIn other words, \u0027name\u0027 is the one variable name that is not available to be passed to a template.\n\nThis matches the convention used in Jenkins Job Builder: that the \u0027name\u0027 variable contains the name of the (for lack of a better phrase) \u0027calling context\u0027 -- in this case (and typically in JJB) the context is a project.",

      "message": "I think this is another case where we\u0027re manipulating too much and ending up with something that is a little farther away from what you would expect either from Zuul or Github.  Instead of using the \u0027label / -label\u0027 syntax, it\u0027s probably more straightforward to just pass the actions through unchanged here, so then the trigger config looks like:\n\n  trigger:\n    github:\n      - event: pull_request\n        action: labeled\n        label:\n          - something-added\n      - event: pull_request\n        action: unlabeled\n        label:\n          - something-removed\n\nSimilarly, the reporter could be:\n\n  success:\n    github:\n      label:\n        - tests pass\n      unlabel:\n        - pending",

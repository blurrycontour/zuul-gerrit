      "message": "This format only really works for gerrit connections. We should defer to a user supplied dict for overrides. However, this starts to look just like reading in a config, so I\u0027m not sure of the value of that.\n\nPerhaps we should consider zuul providing a \u0027readonly\u0027 set of creds. That\u0027d add additional deployment complexity though.\n\nWe should also look into possibly reworking the runner to not require an ssh connection to gerrit instead pulling over http.",

      "message": "Agreed, not sure how far we can go with supporting zero-configuration, though it seems like a great use-case. Perhaps we should start by implementing a zuul-runner.yaml config format. Then when default value could work everywhere, (e.g. by using gerrit\u0027s anon http) we could look into supporting zero-conf.",

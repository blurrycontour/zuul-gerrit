      "message": "The pool is per-process and we would never run more than one scheduler in a process (only in the unit tests will that happen).\n\nThe scheduler now performs db reads and writes synchronously, in the main loop, so it should only ever have one connection at a time active.  If we imagine a unit test with 2 schedulers and one zuul-web, that still only adds up to 3.",

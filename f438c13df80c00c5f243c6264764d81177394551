I\u0027ve already a change that updates the PF4 version while including the tables package (which was necessary as I got some version conflicts otherwise) https://review.opendev.org/#/c/746112/9/web/package.json . But that update didn\u0027t include another (new) patternfly package.\n\nI will check out the rest of this change later today. This was just the first thing that caught my eye ;-)",

      "message": "This shows each queue one at a time, from left-to-right and top-to-bottom.  That\u0027s pretty neat in the gate pipeline view, but for a check pipeline it seems a little weird.  There really is an order to all the items/queues in the pipeline (and that\u0027s important to both users and operators when related to things like node requests or semaphores), but this does seem to hide it a bit.\n\nIf we structure it this way, there will be a learning curve as people realize that not only is there an order to the items in each queue, there is as order to the queues as well, so to see the overall order one reads each queue from left-to-right, then each item in the queue from top-to-bottom, then line-wrapping the queues from top-to-bottom.\n\nThat all becomes a little difficult when one of the queues is very long and the others are short.  Part of what makes this difficult is the design language on other sites like pinterest where unorderdered things of different sizes are thrown into a flex layout.  When we have queues of different sizes, it sort of looks like that, even though it isn\u0027t.  So you have to know that our layout is actually an ordered grid, not a random flex layout, in order to understand it.\n\nThe only idea I have right now to address this is to waste the extra screen width and just always have one column (though to be clear, I don\u0027t think the column should be the full width; I think we should have a max width of a few hundred pixels, then just margin after that).  I think that would be a positive change on the check pipeline, and a negative change on the gate pipeline.  I definitely don\u0027t think we should do something different for them, they should both display the same way.  A benefit of having only a single column would be supporting longer job names without wrapping.\n\nI do think we should decide deliberately whether we want to accept this extra bit of cognitive overhead for understanding pipeline sequencing or not.  I\u0027m on the fence and welcome other thoughts.",

      "message": "I get the point that we might want to improve the layout to clearly show that a check pipeline has multiple queues, respectively that the items in check are independent of each other (running in parallel). I tried out different approaches in the beginning but none of them really worked and made the check pipeline look much weirder than it currently is ðŸ˜„\n\nIn the beginning I used a similar approach for the check pipeline by adding some space in between the queues in the check pipeline. However this looked weird - especially pipelines with a lot of items. One drawback was that I couldn\u0027t manage to get some kind of grid working. So either the beginning or the end of a line didn\u0027t match the previous one and also the items looked completely unordered. Something like the following (X stands for a queue item square/box):\n\nX  XX  X  XXX  X\n X  X  XX  X  X XX\nX  X  X  XX  X  X\n\nHowever this was also based on a flex-layout. I\u0027m pretty sure I also tried using a grid-layout but can\u0027t remember which problems I had with that.\n\nAnyway, if I understood your idea correctly you suggest to divide the space into different columns and show each queue in a single cell (so basically a grid ðŸ˜„). This might waste more space for many \"single change queues\", but maybe works better for aligning the spaces in between the queues and ensure that the items are arranged properly. I\u0027ll try a grid-layout again and see where this leads. Let me know in case I\u0027m on the wrong track here or totally misunderstood your comment.",

      "message": "-1: The visual language on the current status page is that there is a single box that represents the status of the job.  That box can be a blue progress bar if it is currently running.  Or a red progress bar if it is running but will fail.  Or it can be a completely filled in box, red, greed, orange, etc, with a word representing the result of the build.  The filled in box looks like a completed progress bar.  The use of a red progress bar that turns into a filled red box when the job is expected to fail and finally fails really underscores that.\n\nI think we should keep the same visual language as it is useful for communicating about the build, and having them be the same shape make it easy to scan a long list of builds and see what\u0027s going on.

      "message": "right, this might be exposed as an option. Not sure about the default. While \u0027validate\u0027 seems to be the safe default I actually don\u0027t know how this can be accomplished with dynamic nodes as one can only do real cert checking including subject which will be a random ip address. Static nodes probably could be checked. But in order to facilitate this this setting probably needs to come from nodepool.\n\nSo I see these options:\n\n* make configurable with default \u0027validate \u0027. Any deployments with dynamic nodes would need to set this to validate though.\n\n* make configurable with default \u0027ignore\u0027. Kind of unsafe by default but no customization needed in most deployments.\n\n* Configurable in nodepool pool config. This would make it possible to at least validate static nodes.\n\n* Add note to the docs\n\nWhat do you prefer?",

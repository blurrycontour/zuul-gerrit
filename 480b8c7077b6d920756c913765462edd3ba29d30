Unless you have done detailed analysis of the individual lines of code and their commits, I would expect at least the (c) lines from the original file to be copied over.",

      "message": "-1: The old status page included the user-created description of the pipeline, but this one omits it.  However, the generic description of the pipeline manager is still included here as a tooltip.\n\nIf we can find a way to have both, that\u0027s great, but if we can only have one, then I think we should have the pipeline description available on this page.  This is where users and operators are going to see short names like \"gate\" and \"release-post\" all together in close proximity.  They should be able to find out what those words mean without needing to click to go to another page for each one.",

      "message": "-1: Serial pipelines also share that characteristic.  Perhaps they should be added to this list?\n\nEven better, rather than enumerating the types here which risks bitrotting, how about we combine any queues that don\u0027t have names?  That actually matches what you said in your comment (and I think that\u0027s what we really do want to accomplish here), and that\u0027s currently the best way to determine what kind of queue it is (it\u0027s a named queue if it has a name).",

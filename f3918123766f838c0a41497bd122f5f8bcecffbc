      "message": "Wasn\u0027t the error that we saw because we had updated the repo, and the newest commit was in a packfile, which was not what was expected based on the state of the repo when the Repo object was initialized?  The state of the repo can only change three ways:\n\n* update from origin\n* fetch change patchset from origin\n* zuul creates a commit and ref\n\nSince we saw an error when trying to _reset_ the repo, that suggests that the first case is what caused the discrepancy, so this patch recreates the Repo object after each update.",

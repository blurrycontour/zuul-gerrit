AFAIK they will become deprecated in react sooner or later. In the last two years the react developers added a lot new functionality to functional components and there isn\u0027t much left which requires a class based component.\n\nThe most up-to-date components in that regard are the src/containers/logfile/LogFile and /src/containers/FilterToolbar.\n\nIt would be awesome if you could have a look at those components and try to update this component accordingly. What you basically can do is to use the useState() hook to implement the state handling rather than define a state dictionary and use setState(\u003ckey\u003e, \u003cvalue\u003e) to update the values. There is a good introduction to those in the React documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html.",
